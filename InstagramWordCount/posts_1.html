or some shit, but the food was actually so good. i had a lamb shank and like genuinely some of the best food i’ve ever eaten in my life. idk if it’s cause of how hungry i was. but the lamb was just so tender and tasty. idk man shit was so good. like maybe the best food i’ve eaten at a restaurant. hung out with my sis yesterday, and i def feel a lot closer with her nowadays which is good. we def had a moment together and it was nice. i also called with richard, howard, arthur and nimai and that was nice too. i do feel like my social life does really suck, but i do have a support system. i think it mainly sucks with people in vancouver and ig im just navigating that. at the same time i feel like i’ve always struggled with friends but it’s something that i’ve built up slowly. idk i always think about how much i feel about life or everything changes so quickly on a daily basis. this is such an obv statement but idk. it feels weird having beliefs change so fast just from my mood. it just makes me wonder who is the real me. idk sleepy and that.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">we posting my math hw cause no photos. probs did last part wrong but idc. wanted to play tft. uhhh. bruh lowkey was depressed as shit yesterday. didn’t do that well on my psych test i think. but then i went to go to citr after my midterm at like 7:30 and i’m bouta be dramatic. but i saw amanda there and idk interaction was just super mid. and then after i interacted with some old friends i used to talk to but uighkey she was just on her phone the whole time and i was like bruh why did i stand here when i could’ve sat on the bus. and then it fucking hit after where i just kinda realized bruh i got no friends at ubc. in fact i lost friends. not only that but like im not feeling so hopeful about citr. amanda was unironically the only person left that i wanted to talk to and meet. obv it hasn’t been a lot of times we talked but idk having that mid convo just kinda shattered my hopes. and i think for everyone there my hope is kinda shattered where i’m just constantly feeling uncomfortable and im starting to think it’s because i just don’t vibe with these people. i think i’ll still go bc i don’t have anywhere else to really go and maybe i just need to give them more time, but i’m so socially drained. sounds int asf to all of you, but i genuinely dgaf about school or anything else but i just want a social life. but it just seems like i’m getting fucking punished every time i try to be social or get to know people. like idk, everyone who i thought was kinda cool is just ppl i don’t think i could not be close with. and honestly i’m so awkward around them that i’m starting to feel like it’s because i just don’t click more than anything. shit makes me kinda sad tbh. i’m just so burnt out socially and now idrk what to do to meet more people. like idek how to make friends, i can’t even remember how i made my hs friends. lowkey i just piggy back of other people to make friends but i don’t have anyone to piggy back off of. also maybe i’m just

fucking despise that guy. everyone knows i’m left as fuck, but i fucking despise left wing influencers and whatever. including hassan piker. bro making six figures a month and is a fucking commie. bros like “i only buy the necessities” and then buys a 150k car for his community. bro can not take any criticism whatsoever and if you make a valid point he calls you transphobic or is transphobic to you. also he just sits on fucking stream all day doing bare minimum reactions and basically stealing content. hello? bros a marxist talking about we must own our means of production and then steals the views from youtubers who made their own product. hello? i genuinely find that clip so despicable, though there’s no transphobia explicitly said, there’s so much implicit transphobia esp with the line “i hope your life is as bad as it is rn.” and it’s just genuine criticism like idk. also second slide is legit xqc clips title. bros just reacting to 230 ppl dying being like chat, chat chat is that a rocket holy shit. wowwwwww. ICANT. on an unrelated note i hate disclosing any political opinions to ppl irl bc i just don’t want to get into a political argument. it’s unironically too exhausting. i also think i’m really left leaning, but i hate on the left a lot. there’s genuinely a lot of self victimization on the left. and it’s genuinely really annoying a lot of the times. obv i kinda get it bc ppl are just tryna process thru things, but some people just fucking suck at processing things and make things all about themselves. idk man. watching that hassan clip just pisses me off</div><div class="_3-95

_a6-i">grind week starts tmmrw. grinded lowkey hard this weekend, but honestly compared to you guys my hard grind isn’t that hard. i just study for like 3-4 hours straight in the morning and then pretend to study the rest of the day. idk just can’t grind like that. a kinda scary thought is that i don’t really interact with anybody on a daily basis that if i got kidnapped it would probably take like 2-3 weeks for anyone to start to notice. i’ve spent this weekend basically alone, i need some sort of interaction tbh. i think i’ll go to citr tomorrow and study, idk gonna try and interact with people and shit. wish i had friends that i just saw everyday. yk what i mean. like we somehow have lunch together everyday. with friends it feels like such a big time commitment to hangout that i end up hanging out with ppl once every two weeks. maybe i gotta ask for more casual hangouts where we just sit and study for like an hour idk. i spend sm time alone it’s pre crazy. but this is all gods plan to get my next relationship to be me being a househusband to my wife no kap. i was talking to amina yesterday about how i’m really confident in myself and how i don’t feel a need to grind rn, bc if things really get bad ik i will be able to grind and be able to pick myself back up into a good spot. it’s like how i used to hate how i procrastinate but i always do it bc im never punished for it. it’s just kinda how my brain works and ik that if there’s way too much work for me to procrastinate, i’ll just do more before. i have this confidence with school but i genuinely dk if i have this confidence with ppl. ppl for me has been such a big uncertainty bc there’s a good chance i don’t like them. with school ik how the game is and i can play around it. but with people my biggest strength is finding the flaws in the ppl around me. which is nice but also i wish my biggest strength was like being outgoing or smth. i’m also really introverted like shitbsucks. idk, probs gonna go to citr cause like. i need to talk to people and also i need to go outside. i fr don’t see sunlight</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

work. went outside to grab my doordash and i was like holy fuck it’s a really nice day outside wtf why i gotta grind at home. i highkey gotta leave the house more. i went to this cogs and ubc neurosci meet the prof event yesterday. there was a lot of free alc so i had a couple to drink. lowkey i used to hate on having a couple of beers, but 1. im starting to like beer and 2. drinking in moderation is kinda nice getting fucked sucks. lowkey, i was totally not hoping amanda would show up cause she’s in neurosci nope! i ain’t even got feelings like that tho she just in the back of my mind and shi. i talked to this guy named eric and we realized that our moms know each other and shit. he seems pre cool, just a dope person to cut the bullshit with. unironically, talking to other asian men is just ez. also was really social, met a lot of random ppl and shit which was dope. met the neuro sci president and i swear i somehow just find myself networking cause i told him i was interested in uni/ux design and he was like bro join our marketing team you can work on the website. and i was like bruh idk if i got that much experience tbh and he’s like nah but your style is good you got it. so i’ll think about doing that but idk generally kinda crazy how i just lowkey be doing networking. i also met sam, the girl from my hs who’s like a year older for the first time. idk she seems cool honestly not a lot of thoughts. i have ig a lot of friends in the early stages but not a lot of friends at all. like every person i talk about on this spam account i’m on the very early stages of getting to know ppl which kinda sucks. uhh, i just called amina and it was nice catching up with her. i honestly need to interact with ppl on this spam account more, sometimes i forget how natural conversations should be. i genuinely do feel way more like myself when convos with ppl im friends with happen and also i feel way more comfortable just saying really random shit or going on random ass tangents. i also unironically feel way more comfortable roasting or calling ppl&#064;out when im actually friends with them.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

girl named wenwen and she seems cool. i remember i was talking to her and she was like “do you like techno music? i’m going to this techno event after.” and i asked her if she was inviting me and she was like ye if you want to go. but highjkey i did not want to go cause i was like i’m alr too drunk for a tuesday alsonim feeling tired and not social. but also i wanted to go bc i feel like she seems pre cool and i wanted to try and be friends with her and try to make connections. idk unironically putting myself out there sm, i’ve been feeling hella uncomfortable constantly bc i’m putting myself out there. overall, idk how i feel about citr, some of the regulars are annoying but some rando ppl you meet are cool. i think generally ppl are pre cool bc they’re more alt, literally wenwen and this other girl named jin listen to bladee which was chill but i just realized these are the first two girls i’ve ever met that listen to bladee. huh. amanda didn’t pull up bc she was super busy but i’m like kinda sad cause i genuinely do want to get to know her better. ig citr is nice bc everyone is alt and queer, but like not annoying. actually some are annoying, like nicole man she is annoying. i talked to my therapist for the first time in 6 weeks and she kinda made me realize i need to be less hard on myself for slacking at school and not leaving my room. my goal for this sem was to put myself out there and i’ve actually been really doing that and subconsciously i have not really given a shit about school bc that’s been my attitude the entire time. at the end of the day school gets done and my grades are worse but i’m alr in my major. idk man i lowkey don’t have any friends at ubc. also, i don’t think i can ever really be a part of community bc i’ll always find some ppl annoying. im trying my best right now i think</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202311/397526410_861949372256195_2344853619127313174_n_17974459739457027.jpg"><img

fucked. didn’t get much sleep today. uhhh, need to spend more time socializing, i highkey hermited the last 5 days and barely went outside. was not good for me. went to the music collective at citr today and it was okay. it was kinda boring bc it was mainly two ppl talking about their concert experiences. mfw i’ve been to one concert yay. maybe i should go to more concerts but also i only really feel like going to concerts if it’s an artist i really fucking like. ye. idk, the ppl are pre cool, person named jay seems like a music head and really chill. general vibes is pre good. ig i’m still getting comfortable with everyone. okay unironically i don’t have a crush on amanda but i genuinely am disappointed that she’s been busy and i haven’t seen her since. i genuinely think she’s a cool person and that our vibes matched so i actually want to get to know her but she’s really busy rn and it just sucks. there’s also a citr party tmmrw and i’m excited to go to that. in general i’m like ? about citr. i think the hangout with nicole and her constant talking about herself woke me up and i kinda realized that with such a huge community at citr there’s gonna be ppl im not gonna like and there’s a big chance that i don’t like the ppl at citr. unironically, i don’t think i’ll ever have a community, i just end up not liking ppl too much. but ye :(. i just need to find a social group to call home. i was talking to my sister the other day and she was telling me how she has never been really single. ever since grade 10 she’s been in a relationship or a situation ship and she’s never serially been single. and she basically told me she doesn’t want her and her gf will eventually breakup bc she wants to move and actually be single and independent. shit is literally the opposite of

two people and i was like highkey thinking about cancelling too but i would feel bad so i pulled up. idm one of them she’s pre cool but also lowkey enabling this other girl. like no hate but this other girl named nicole is fr kinda annoying. like she kinda like emily rees 😭😭. actually she’s better but idk she just feels like an insane coper. shes just always trauma dumping, but honestly i think what’s really bad about her trauma dumping is that she’s always talking about herself. idk, i shouldn’t have to know you go to therapy, tried to kys, got sexually assaulted and broke up with your ex when i’ve seen you twice. like bro quit yapping about yourself. i think i’ve had some moments where i talk about myself but lowkey i just get interrupted and after that i was like nahhh i don’t feel like talking about myself or bonding over shared experience. she’s just yapping about herself so much. also, she’s just coping. her therapist says she’s really avoidant of her emotions which makes a lot of sense, she talks about things in her life without emotion but it’s clear she’s lowkey sympathy baiting. but not even that, she just does so many things to cope and avoid her emotions like BRO let yourself fucking feel. i feel like this woman has more exes than random woman i’ve idealized. yk it clicked. if you yap about going to therapy and don’t mention it on the lowkey you’re fucking insufferable. like i’m not tryna be “shut up liberal” but lowkey therapy can make ppl complacent with how things are. just the nature of accepting things, ppl just take it too far and become complacent. but idk if you yap aboit going to therapy 20 min in talking to you it’s like lowkey i want attention syndrome. idk, i just find the whole thing annoying (i’m bouta be pretentious for a sec) bc the one thing i’m not is a fucking coper. i genuinely believe i faced all my emotions relatively head on and bc of that was able to process and understand them. and ultimately grow from

topics. idk yk how i lowkey be yapping about the fact that i don’t love anyone. idk i def feel like my hearts been opening up nowadays. like all of a sudden i feel like i love my sister and my mom. which feels really weird, but also kind of makes sense bc i’ve reached mental stability now. so i feel like subconsciously i’ve kinda opened up more. but not even that, idk i def wasn’t closed off just bc i was scared of love, but i just felt unsupported? i think i was so far removed and deep in my thoughts that idk if anything could support me. i think both of them have improved in supporting me but idk i think i’ve just been able to open up. i thought i would have way more thoughts on this but i think i spend too much time rationalizing and thinking about my emotions rather than just appreciating them. but i’ve been really able to appreciate way more with my mental state now. and i feel really appreciative of the people on the spam. i think for a long time i’ve always had a me vs the world mentality, bc i’ve done a lot by myself but i’ve really undervalued others. though none of you really helped me process thru anything, you’ve shown up with the only way you can and should, with just being my friend and spending time with me. at my lowest point at the ward the only reason i felt motivation to leave and get on with my life was bc my friends were there for me. and you guys even bought a gift after which was really nice and idk. it’s crazy. at that point in my life it was honestly the only thing keeping me going. if i didn’t have any friends i wouldn’t know what to do. i would have probably died fr. that’s a crazy thought tho, that you saved my life. it’s so ridiculous bc you were just there. i used to think that genuine human connection was when someone would do a profound and big display of love and somehow be there to save my life. but i’ve come to realize that just being there, saying the most shitter banter about dumb things that don’t really matter is what human connection is about. it’s absurd. i used to think life needed such grand and great purpose, but i’ve realized the smallest interactions can</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

tbh, this day feels more meaningful than my bday, it’s just a nice day to reflect on how far i’ve come. it’s also crazy that a core memory of mine is spending halloween in the psyche ward. real. but how do i feel? pre good honestly. it’s been like almost two months no therapy. and it’s not even cause i’m intentionally not tryna go, it’s more just i never feel the need to book an appointment. if i’m breaking down that week i end up procrastinating and once i remember again i realize that i’m fine. i go thru all my hard emotions by myself tbh. i think what feels shitty nowadays is the fact that i only really process all my emotions by myself, idk don’t have any emotional supports. but yeah, i’ve genuinely come really far tbh. like bruh i’m kinda jacked now which is crazy considering all the days i was unable to leave my bed. and this school year i’ve never put myself out there so hard tbh. at the end of the day i do genuinely feel like i make such great leaps in my life every 6 months, unironically changing a lot. i’m honestly pre hopeful? that citr will be a community i can enjoy, but idk don’t want to set my expectations too high. nevertheless the fact that i’m joining clubs is crazy, i’ve always lowkey just been a clubs hater ever since hs. idk, i haven’t thought enough to make this post but i do genuinely find it hard to write this post bc im so far removed from who i was three years ago and the headspace i was in that i can’t appreciate it. when people ask me how i was doing i used to lie and say i was doing good but now people ask me and all i say is “im chilling idk, just legit chilling.” and i genuinely do mean it. i’m so serious when i say this, nothing stresses me out anymore. failing my math test stressed me out for the morning but i got over it, but it wasn’t even stress it was just annoyance and anger. but i might be grinding school and have a shit ton of assignments due. but i’m never really</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

too tired. waking up too hard everyday. like it’s so weird. how unmotivated i am to start my day. designed to be a cat fr. with that being said, it’s good that i’m doing sm. been consistently been social and doing random shit that i’m pre exhausted socially. this sounds like complete cope from me, but if i’m being this social and intentional with people, i don’t feel a need for a gf. i could honestly survive for a decent amount of time without one. like genuinely i only feel a need for a gf when i feel lonely and when i’m not being social. feel like a gf is just almost the easy way out in my head of being social and being forced to do social things. but ye feel fulfilled with my social life rn, obv things can be better with friends but i’m putting in a lot of effort. with that being said i feel like i haven’t really seen any of my close friends at ubc. sadge!! idk do want to hang out with ppl&#064;im more comfortable with soon. as much as i like going to citr, they’re a lot of moments where i stand awkwardly not knowing what to do, and i’m def restraining who i am bc im not comfortable. i need to say some unhinged weird shit unironically. been tryna act too normal. also my main ig fucking sucks. like lowkey i be posting cringe in my captions, but i don’t regret it, i think it’s fucking hilarious. like it’s def content i want to post csuse i love subverting the expectations of ppl that alr know me bc ik it won’t really do anything. but giving out my ig fucking sucks cause i’m tryna be cool and like not be cringe and now they’re forming an image of me in their head based off stupid shit i say on ig. gg!! joever. but idk, everyone at citr has been really accepting?? of me. like they actually think i’m cool or smth. idk what i’ve done, usually i feel like i’m awk. i’m going to hangout with them on saturday which is dope idk yay!! sleepy tho.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

more talking about woman on this spam account. okay not really but no more like crushing on woman without knowing them. the content i produce is really funny when i do, but i also just become delusional and get way too attached with the idea of her that any interaction with her will shatter my image of her. also it’s cringe. ye so there’s that. she didn’t even do anything bad i was just delusional so i’m genuinely gonna stop talking about rando crushes other than maybe a mention. all i should’ve said was she’s cool and i fuck wit her vibe and called it. anyways, i met a lot of people at citr today tho. i def feel a little bit more a part of the community there. met a lot of ppl and everyone is really nice. met this girl (forgot her name), but she’s a neuro major switching into electrical eng and she was talking about how much she loves physics and we kinda bonded over that which was dope. i was talking about how i want to double major and she said that was really cool which really reaffirmed me idk. idk about double majoring, it’s a lot of work and idk. maybe minor but also i really do enjoy physics. but at the start it was rough, it’s very uncomfortable and awk bc i am an outsider so idk i just have to be super intentional with everything which sucks. but i ended up finding people to talk to. idk i def feel more apart of the group and more comfortable. i have def not been really expressing myself that much but i feel myself more comfortable and hopefully more expressive. i’m gonna go on a weird tangent here cause idk. i feel like this tangent will make it seem like i think this woman is flirting with but it really isn’t. idk as i was leaving, the president (whom i met 10 min ago) really encouraged me to come back and put her pinky out to make me pinky promise her that i would come back. idk, this just feels like such a weird gesture to me. pinky promises feel really intimate, like only close friends shit so idk just feels super weird for her to do it. so ig it just feels really personal? ig she was doing her job of being president by doing something so personal and retaining people, but at the</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

are a little cringe and boring but idk that just happens. def did feel like an outsider bc i am lol. anyways, there was this girl named like amanda and she just looked based idek how to describe it. her fit was kinda nice but idk ig the vibe she gave off felt like it was my vibe. also she just looks based idek how to say it. but she complimented my nerv/eva bag and my ricks (holy guck this is so cringe can we interpret this sentence in a casual matter of fact way instead of omg she’s so esoteric like me!!!! way, thanks). idk guess i just liked the vibes she was giving off. i study with them, and i eventually i take the bus with her home. and we talk about the things we have in common. she’s in neuroscience not to be in med but bc she loves it which is so based. i love that for her. also im in cogs which like based or what. lowkey same major. we kinda have the same music taste, she’s a k-pop stan typa person but she fucks with odd eye circle which is based. we also lowkey both got music bro taste. also she’s like “i’ve been listening to a lot of actual indie asian music” and i showed her a song that came up on my discovered weekly. also she loves eva and the way she talks about it is with genuine passion. like man that’s based. also we’re both</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

kap. i like hanging out with my sister. than i for high asf with my friends. being high is fun but the day after fucking sucks. i just lowkey want to kms the day after. it’s horrible. i just feel like dying. like legit. should’ve went to the gym and done hw today. but whatever not a huge deal that i didn’t. gonna grind tmmrw. played a bunch of cs2. i feel like i’m constantly just fighting for time. shit sucks tbh. i just wanna not feel like i’m always scrambling for time. like i want to take my time and get ready. or play cs2 without having to worry about other shit. but also i need to spend more time with friends. ye. but was super sleepy today, took a fat fucking nap by accident. honestly, university is pre isolating and stressful. it kinda sucks. idk man, double majoring is probs not it, im just too lazy. i also think living off campus has so many adjustments. i just need to go to class or be motivated to actually go on campus. shit sucks. my sister also talked about how she could see her breaking up with her gf in the future. it makes sense cause since she was like 15 she’s never really been single. and also bc she wants to move internationally by herself. i understand her but ig it’s a crazy idea for me. ig we’re such opposites in a way? she wants to move while i really would love to stay home. and she sees a short term relationship while i’ve been dying for a long term one. and i’ve beeen single for the majority of my life while she’s has not. idk just crazy to think about how she’s been in a relationship for almost half her life.</div><div class="_3-95

i do a basic human function. idk, realized i was getting complacent and just staying inside i decided to start actually tryna talk to people. but the problem is, i’m not designed to live in human society fr. im actually too sleepy and lazy why could i not be a fat. idk, think what my adhd fucks me over the most is that my bed is too fucking lit and i end up not doing a lot of things that would fulfill me cause im tired. also, waking up or doing things is literally the hardest part of my days nowadays. i literally just dk how to do it, when i was depressed as shit i would just lay in bed. and like lowkey it was good that i stayed at home and rotted in my bed. but now i just dk how to get up in the lording and get my day started. ig there’s just been a lot of habits that formed when i was depressed that i never thought about. it’s good that these are my problems nowadays tho instead of wanting to fucking blow my brains out. also, i suck at socializing. it’s quite ironic, i would say that i have high emotional intelligence bc 3 years of therapy. but with that being said i fucking suck at talking to strangers. i’m like awkward, also i just zone out a lot just randomly so sometimes i just stand somewhere silent and thinking. not goated. sux. also, idk how to act to like ppl idk. like HIGHKEY to my friends i just act weird as shit or annoying.z cause it’s kinda funny. i’m too used to acting weird that idk how to act normal when i get to know someone. sux. anyways, had an insanely long day!! i really wanted to just lay down the whole day but i’m really glad that i

intimidated by my body bc it’s kinda scary to look at, so they try to be more aggressive. or it could be almost an ego thing of taking down a guy that’s way bigger. either way it kinda sucks for me cause i actually really want to work on my technique and actually am really bad at muay thai. idk, it’s esp bad bc i feel as if my defence is way worse than my offence, so it kinda stays worse cause my partner is being too aggressive and i can’t work on my fundamentals. i actually want to be treated the same as everyone else. idk i gotta stop bitching so hard about ryan’s club tho, he puts in hella work for it and in general it’s actually a really good club. sometimes ppl are annoying but he can’t really control it. and in general the classes are really good and i actually learn infinite. i feel like decent at fighting now bc i know how much i fucking suck at it. that sounds weird to say but like there are so many things i could improve on with fighting that i feel like i understand fighting way more by knowing how shit i am. and it actually seems really fun, like neutral games seem genuinely really interesting and fine tuning technique is fun. and i genuinely think he’s made the best out of the situation he’s had. i just bitch about random shit. speaking of, this is totally out of his control bc classes need to be fun and interesting. but i wish there was just more fundamental training. i actually kinda miss training in a dojo bc you just do boring shit but really good at it. it makes sm sense why dojo preach discipline so hard. like bruh i would be down to just fucking sit there and practice kicking for 1 hour. “i do not fear the man who practiced a 1000 kicks one time but the man who’s practiced</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

have these problems so i get the right to complain about them bc you don’t get them. i pu to this ryan muay thai class and ppl were complimenting how jacked i am, and lowkey it’s annoying me. i went to preface this that i appreciate when you guys compliment a lot like genuinely 🥹🥹. esp this one guy, he kinda stopped me and was like, “yo how are you so jacked” like what am i supposed to respond idk i workout? like how else do you get jacked. okay that’s kinda braindead but after he said “it’s not fair” and lowkey that kinda actually pissed me off, ik he probs meant well by it but like bruh it’s not fair? my ass is literally in the gym 5 days a week 2 hours a day. i literally used to program my entire life going to the gym like hello? it’s not fair? like buddy i worked my ass off for this fucking body like hello? like buddy i’ve endured more pain on a daily basis than you have in your entire life. man thinking about that shit pisses me off, ik it’s such a stupid thing to complain about and he’s just trying to compliment me, but shit fr annoys me. but in general there’s just like too many ppl complimenting me. ik it’s my fault cause i’m wearing tha wife beater so i’m literally showing my entire body off. but like unironically i have no clothes to workout in, i only have like shirts i actually wear and i’m not pulling up to every session in the red mickey mouse shirt. also unironically i feel very confident in the wife beater. i think maybe it’s the introvert in me that is just sick of getting complimented for being jacked. like how do i even respond to it. i just end up fumbling and saying something along the lines of thank you. idk for some reason i actually don’t like receiving compliments from strangers. maybe it’s the fact i feel like i’m getting treated differently, or maybe my ass just does not trust ppl who start a convo with a compliment. idk it just means nothing to me bc lowkey i’ve gotten a lot of compliments about my body. it’s lowkey the same thing with fits, when girls complement my fit i lowkey don’t give af. i just get it sm it doesn’t even mean anything. the last time compliment</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

funnier. but unironically tilted over thay shit. fuck these couples. bruh i’ve been unironically begging my friends to set me up on blind dates and shit. it’s funny asf when i ask but i’m also being lowkey dead serious. problem is they always tell me idrk any girls that you would like. and i’m like bruhh it’s joever. btw if you got any girls i would like please tell me man i need girls. but

months where woman will just start posting about how nerdy guys are the move. and like i don’t think they’re necessarily lying, like bruh i could not date a woman who has no hobbies or personality. but at the same time they’re all just lowkey bait videos, essentially baiting nerdy men to feel validated by a woman on their phone who probs wouldn’t be attracted to them irl. all these videos forget to preface that they want attractive nerdy men, which isn’t inherently bad, like ppl have standards. but it def feels like such bait and i think it just annoys me to see these posts pop off bc nerds are getting baited. it annoys me on both sides, like the woman baiting and the dumbass men not seeing the bait. it’s like bruh this is so braindead. first post esp pisses me off bc the example definition for dork just simply feels manipulative to me. it’s essentially “i want a man who is socially inept.” like hello? being dorky and nerdy is like having interests not being socially inept. it just feels likes this woman wants a man who she can lowkey manipulate socially. or maybe i’m looking too far deep into it. but idk it just gives me such ick energy. or like when woman say i want a submissive loser man. like man fuck you, you just want a man to fucking manipulate and be your fucking toy. obv not all woman are like this and there’s probs a higher percentage of men who are just weirder or more manipulative, but idk these videos just put me off. i think a lot of it is that i obv identify as a nerdy man, but that’s a lot of vulnerability to admit to a woman. and ig when i see posts kinda taking advantage of that vulnerability it just puts me off and saddens that ppl are just getting farmed for likes. and i honestly inherently don’t trust ppl who are willing to say this shit, my nerdy/vulnerable side is something that someone earns through my trust, and not something i will show on my first date. it really feels like this guy bringing a printed copy of questions is really putting himself out there and being vulnerable and it just feels so disgusting that his vulnerability is being displayed</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

wanted to say i’m so chronically online. like i don’t think i’ve met anyone as chronically online as i am tbh. which reminds me i was in this student led phil discussion and the guy running said “opium to cope with the existential crisis of life” and i was losing my shit cause i knew how badly he was trying not to say copium and it was sooooo fucking funny. yeah idk these posts are really shit i feel like when i just moved to van again my spam posts were really good and thoughtful. im too busy to think. maybe i can just hornypost. it’s it even hornyposting tho it’s more like lonelyposting. uhh. i keep&#064;on saying hello randomly. i’ll just be like hello? and it’s worst cause than i’ll start talking to myself about how i need to stop saying hello randomly. pre sure my

guaranteed productivity time. so i might as well go. worst comes to worst i will just do hw while the lecture is going on. plus going to class motivates me to wake up and start my day. and that’s the hardest part of everyday. starting my day. im really bad at starting my day and i need to get better at it. i don’t want to blame my adhd, but thinking about all the things i need to do in the day fucking suck. but i actually did it all today and it wasn’t even bad. so&#064;i just gotta remember, it seems harder than it really is. i do miss when i had all the time in the world, everyday seems like kinda grind with all this hw. but really i don’t have a lot of hw just starting it seems really hard. but that’s why i gotta start going to class, so i have like 0 hw. idk also just been playing lots of video games. ye. want to skate more but also want to sit at home and play video games. think i will try and skate tmmrw. i think what kinda sucks about skating and a lot of hobbies is that i feel like it’s more fun when you get good. idk, it just feels really ass not being able to really do anything unless i grind for like a hour to do it. but also i think i’m going to be like a rail

do anything. and it was really loud too so it was just so fucking uncomfortable i hated it. the assignment was kinda easy tho, i’ve heard first assignment is ez asf. but also just cringe to do. school is a lot of boring work tbh. like homework is just kinda bedge, just gotta get thru it. i’m highkey behknd asf tho. gotta start grinding a bit to get back on track. my french class is fucking useless. lowkey i skip every other class and than catch up the next class. it’s lowkey the strat it’s two classes it one. idk tho lowkey stressing gotta grind a bit. been superrrrr fucking busy it’s crazy. school has been busier. also it’s just been really bad for math and physics cause i gotta start remembering how to do everything and my math is super fucking rusty. like idk if sin0 is 1 or 0 i

home. which just sucked. but ik i had to get out of bed. couldn’t repeat yesterday. had a good but bad gym sesh. was really sad at the start ngl, but felt such cathartic relief at the end. reminds me how important the gym is for me in terms of cathartic relief. really need to go to the gym more consistently. after that went to the cogs friend meeting thing. and met some decently cool people. lowkey think this girl named emily was into me before i started opening my mouth. idk kept on looking at me at the start. maybe i’m just narcissistic tho. she’s cute but kind of annoying. she acts really dumb in social situations which is honestly fine. or she is really dumb? idk but she would just say such braindead shit. which was honestly cool that’s not a deal breaker. but than she would flex her grades to prove that she’s not dumb which is just icky behaviour. idk feeling the need to say “i got a 96 in phil 220” or be like “i was the top in my words class” is just so icky. i get how it can feel annoying to be viewed as dumb when your not, but if you’re playing the persona of a dumb individual you gotta fucking commit to it. or atleast prove your intelligence in a more lowkey way. she’s still cool but idk huge ick. with that being said, i just played board games with this group. which was cool but i def wished i stepped out of my shell a bit and started talking to a different group. i was very outgoing and tbh loud, but lowkey it’s cause we’re playing secret hitler and that’s the type of game im v outspoken about. so i just had this outspoken and loud personality which is somewhat a part of me, but very far from who i’m generally am. i also was honestly pre mean to emily; yk how everyone bully’s the dumb one in friend groups? i was doing that to her. def was like too honest when she said stupid shit. but she would say a lot of stupid shit. overall, im proud of myself for stepping out of my shell. i wish i did more, but i made good progress. i def do think cogs people are really cool tho. it has the nerdiness to them which i kinda crave</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

skipping class to catch up on the sleep i missed. this kinda perpetuated itself into me feeling like shit and just not doing anything today. idk wanted to go outside but i also just had no motivation. think my adhd really fucks me here, when i’m cooped up in my room it’s so hard for me to do anything. i couldn’t do anything today if my life depended on it. idk maybe i’m just making excuses but i forget how hard it is to just leave slumps. plus i was just feeling kinda horrible. days like these reminds me this was my day to day 3 years ago. depressed asf with no real direction or motivation to do anything. i don’t feel as shit as i used to, there isn’t shit to hate myself over. and i also just understand that days where i just feel like shit will just happen. i’ll try harder tomorrow. there’s this cogs thing that i’m gonna go to, and i’ll pull up&#064;to muay thai class. i’ll workout tmmrw for sure. things def didn’t pan out in an optimal way today but that’s okay. idk generally pre positive nowadays. it’s also weird cause i woke up&#064;today and suddenly was just very disinterested with the girl i was texting to on hinge. def felt very lonely today tho, ig the biggest reason i’ve always wanted a gf is bc i’ve wanted someone to support me while i am depressed and get me out of the slump. it’s a pre selfish reason, esp before when i was depressed as shit, but i’ve always dealt with these by myself. i think it would be nice to have a girl tell me things will be okay or force me to get out of bed and do something small with her. ig it’s like my only need that hasn’t been met yet. but ik i’m trying my best, i’ve been a lot more open and accepting this semester. i’ve tried a lot of new things out and i’m really putting myself out there. i’m genuinely doing the best i can and even tho i fail or don’t do things i wanted to, i genuinely do believe i’m doing the best i can. i would be proud of the person i’ve become. and today is just a reminder of how far i came.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202309/380945014_277491718492676_2942852754022583756_n_17981090354274482.jpg"><img

don’t want to talk to you if you don’t call me bro. or tell me about how you basically scam customers so you can earn more commission. i was just super comfortable with him, it was a guy so i would just say video games and he would know it. he asked me if i was watching anything and i responded “k-on” and he was like flabbergasted by that response and he was like “i’ve watched k-on but why’d you think i know it.” or we would just flame each other and it was lit tbh. idk overall reallly good time and unironically he got the stylist loyalty. plus he’s pre good. matched with this woman on hinge and she’s unironically talking to me. me when a girl on a dating app (an app designed to meet and talk to people) actually responds. bruh i swear girls just match and don’t respond or talk. like i got negative rizz but it’s not even the negative rizz fault fr. getting to know her is making me kinda like her, she seems cool. but i highkey just don’t expect anything to happen bc. it’s a fucking dating app. like idk. shit always sucks. there’s so many times where i’m just fucking doom scrolling thru girls. ye. did a lot of hw today tbh. and generally was just surprisingly productive. crazy

so for me the kickflip didn’t emotionally process as a W. which kinda sucks i was grinding for so long just for the kickflip i landed to not feel that good. like lowkey it still felt good to kinda land it tbh it felt really good but apart of me wishes i didn’t land it cause then when i landed it cleanly i would’ve been hype as fucking shit. but whatever. just went to gym and lost progress, swear it’s cause i got too fucked friday. had a lot of fun but the hangover was just not worth it and lowkey i think the way i act while i’m drunk is embarrassing. it just doesn’t feel like who i am and also i need some social anxiety when i’m drunk cause i just act cringe as shit. plus i lost progress at gym today so i’m pissed.z im like decently behind in school rn, not the best but pre sure i can catch up today. idk overall feeling okay, ig i’ve been feeling shittier? bc i was just hungover and i still feel like shitty emotionally from drinking. plus i didn’t do the birdwatching club today which i really wanted to do bc i felt like i needed to reset and get my shit together in life. which just kinda sucks. i went on hinge again cause i with ryan again and idk how i feel about it. ig everything has just been a lowkey shitty feeling just cause i so fucked friday. this is why i just don’t really drink, my overall life quality just kinda goes to shit. and i do have fun but i don’t think it’s worth it overall. id rather be stable instead of have an insane high and then feel like shit after. also every time i’m drunk i think about how lonely i feel and that always kinda sucks. i

vintage reseller place. i lowkey just went to hate. i just wanted to see the absurd prices they would charge for like a used carhartt workwear jacket (around $150). i remember picking up this yankee bomber and person told me $300 and i lost my shit. but also just wanted to know what the fashion meta is for normies rn. workwear still popping tf off. varsity jackets still hitting. double knees still going crazy. workwear is more interesting bc the more used the pants look the more they will sell (esp if it has paint splatters). it’s a little cringe but ye. idk just hating, esp on shirts. some of the shirts are horse shit and $40. but i did buy some trueys for 60. think they worth, fuck with the maximalist look on trueys. plus $60 on trueys not even bad. someone asked me to do a fit run down and that shit was awk i thought he just wanted a pic. bruh i was awk asf can’t even lie. after chilled on call with stephen for like 6 hours. shit was nice i actually have really good friends nowadays. like fr got some quality ass friends. genuinely, it is crazy how much orogesss i’ve made socially and how easily i will disregard it bc “no gf = no progress.” actually cringe. shoutsout to everyone fr. talked to this guy in my physics class. was okay but he kinda annoyed me cause he was making excuses about why he couldn’t do some problems when i was helping him. just cringe tbh. but overall he seemed nice. idk def trying very hard to meet new people and talk to them. this been the most open i’ve ever been. gonna def try to meet new people in my phil class. also haven’t skated in a while feels pre bad. pre sure cause my last skate session was mid i don’t want to go which is a shit excuse. all goodge tho. also need to focus on working out more.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a

going to psych class is hella useless and it’s a 3 hour class that starts at 5. but i went cause i didn’t leave my house and i wanted to meet new people. i talked to two girls there and bruh those convos actually fucking suck. the first one was just like idk?? it just felt really strained, it was hard to talk about anything interesting and she def tried to talk to me but at the same time idk she was shy? but it was just a very awkward convo and very forced. and the second one fucking sucked. this girl put in no effort to talk back to me and i was like bruh ain’t no way i’m getting disrespected like that so i stopped trying. my fit was way better tho so fuck her. also speaking of my fit, i think i lowkey made my magnum opus fit, jk it’s not that cool but everything is proportioned so nicely and idk i kinda love it. and not only that some random dude at the grocery store line who (no offence) does not look like he cares about clothes at all complimented my fit. that’s fucking goated cause like it’s clear he doesn’t care like clothes like a girl will when she compliments my fit. like bruh that gotta be the most goated compliment of all time. anyways, really trying to meet new people here. gotta continue putting myself out there and constantly try to meet new people and do new things. i’ve had so many awkward and strained convos, maybe i fucking suck at talking to strangers but i’m gonna keep trying!! also need to meet gf!!! or i will go crazy!! ok but unironically i was talking to my therapist and i’ve made a lot of progress socially. i’ve become more way open to my friends challenging me. and honestly therapy isn’t that useful anymore bc my friends have been challenging way more than my therapist has. guess i’m like graduating therapy or smth. really proud of that change and really happy that i feel close enough to people that they can challenge me. but it feels like no progress bc unironically i’m so cringe and i think no gf = no progress. but unironically i be making so many fake scenarios about having a gf and thinking about them makes me excited. like imagining i’m just making food for them</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a

but i gotta be around ppl i trust. was feeling a bit depressed today and i kinda realized it’s cause i’m not acting out of my values. was being sheltered. so i was really iffy on going to chess club today. but i decided to go even if i didn’t really want to play chess just bc i deserve to give myself opportunities to meet new people. and i went it was really fun. i played against this 1600 and lowkey popped off against him, i obv lost but i actually held my own and i blundered a central pawn but was able to reconcile really well. i just played really good fundamental chess until i got my knight forked and then i lost. but lowkey i’m so bad at calculsting, i be like this move looks good or this move looks like shit. i also&#064;play really slowly it’s bad. overall it was a good time and i will be going back. also talked with amina. it’s nice talking to her feel like i can actually say some real shit. also analyzed the shit out of one of our mutuals and idk. my analysis goes hard when i really dislike someone. or know someone for an extended period of time. overall, i really wish to meet more people but i’m doing little things in order to achieve that. and i think that matters a lot. i want to text this old friend and catch up with her, but idk i haven’t talked to this woman in years. i really just want to thank her, back when i was in grade 7 she made me promise not to cut myself and i was like “wtf i will never do that why are you making me promise this” and lowkey whenever i wanted to cut myself i would think about that. and i ended up never cutting myself. so i honestly just want to thank her. it feels super weird asking her to hangout tho just bc i feel like i haven’t said a word to her in years. ye that’s all.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

crossed at a party. lowkey maybe i should just drink a fuck ton at a party. that’s my social drug. unironically, i feel like i’ve said to myself that i’m scared of woman so much as a joke that i’m actually scared of woman. but fr tho i do feel very vulnerable when im incapacitated. i think a huge part of it is like unironically i can’t hate anymore. i feel like i’m really good at testing someone’s vibe and seeing if i like someone when i’m sober, but once i’m drunk that observation and ability to discern red flags is gone. and then i’ll realize that and get scared. it doesn’t help that im kinda socially inept when i open my mouth when i’m sober, and when im drunk it’s like 10x worse. i think i genuinely found it hard to talk bc i was so fucking crossed. i also genuinely do think there were woman actually flirting with me at the party. but i didn’t really fuck with their personalities i think. this sasha girl is wasian and lowkey it fucking clicked. i don’t fuck with wasians. they personality is off or smth. i’m pre sure she was hitting on me tho, i think she tried to grab my hand and drag me somewhere but i was like so crossed that i didn’t know what was going on and just ignored it. or she was talking to me the entire party and lowkey i was just kinda disassociating and staring off. i just didn’t really like her vibe tho, she’s like loves travelling and every summer goes backpacking and after uni she wants to go backpacking for two years in asia. and i’m like bruh??? my hottest take is travelling is overrated. and she parties a lot like it’s just too much extroverted energy. also was attention seeking a lot. it’s sm easier to see after but during the moment it was hard to discern these red flags so lowkey instead i just got scared and went back to my friends to get more high and be in my own world. also like highkey i feel lonely as shit when im drunk and i think i just act weird bc one part of me wants to meet new people but another part is honestly scared bc one of my strongest traits isn’t active. unironically tho tamara lowkey traumatized me i do not trust</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

mid. i also just think less people were chill ig. unironically i’m scared of woman. there was this girl named sasha who i think was hitting on me. and i think i’m really stupid bc i think she tried to flirt with me and idek how to respond so i think i just denied all her flirting. she lowkey gave me the hella ick tho cause she was texting this other guy well talking to me. but it’s not even like she’s tryna hit on this guy she texting i think, cause that’s her homies crush. so idk just super ick that you are on your phone while talking to me. also. idk just didn’t really vibe with her. thought i did and just realized that i was super fucked and my she was just flirting with me. also. i was super tucking crossed and unironically i was like bro i feel very vulnerable and very scared rn so i lowkey was like no more talking to strangers esp woman trying to hit on me. like that’s scary man i do not want to&#064;have sex i regret again. lots of ppl complimented my outfit which was really nice and i love. but i was literally too crossed to just figure anything out. overall the function kinda sucked. idk didn’t vibe with many people and i feel&#064;like i met a lot less ppl than i usually do at parities. but that’s cause i wasn’t really drunk enough. also realized that im actually pre scared of&#064;woman esp if im really fuckedup idk sex is scary!!! but at the same time i realized i just really want to feel the touch of a woman that loves me and cares for&#064;me&#064; and cares for me and shit. like man where’s the girl that i’ll be comfortsbke&#064;enough to cuddle

your clothes and you didnt even realize you fell asleep and you wake up super fucking disoriented and you don’t even know what’s going on or what happened. i love those naps tbh, it’s like bruh what happened do i even exist. my head just hurts and i just feel lazy and groggy as shit. tried to skate today but didn’t have any particularly long sesh. just didnt really feel like skating, esp cause one of them was after my long ass nap. for sure didn’t want to do anything after that. idek why im posting tbh. got nothing to say. going to a house party tmmrw. pre hyped cause house parties are genuinely fun. oh i remember what i wanted to say. my friend group told me i missed drunk carsyn. and like i totally get what they’re coming from, they all met me when i was drunk and being drunk brings a whole different side to me that is almost the polar opposite of who i am. i’m usually an introverted and exclusive? guy but when i’m drunk i’m loud and kinda obnoxious but very loving and accepting of everyone. i think it just really encapsulates why i want other friends. they def can serve a purpose in my life, but i just don’t think i fit with them at my neutral state. esp with the fact that i don’t even like drinking that much. but idk it’s kind of a crazy thing to say. like it kinda sounds like “i only like you when i’m drunk.” which is lowkey kinda true when im sober and talking to them im just kind of a npc and i don’t really contribute much to the convo. but ye. this meme fr too good. ong sometimes i be thinking too much. like nobody knows anything about life but you feel things!!! listen to your heart!!!! fr tho.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

success. took me like three tries to record cause i kept on being out a frame 😭😭. but trick is ez asf, ong it’s cause i grinded ollie’s for so long. shit is fun asf too. like hitting the fs 180 i just feel cool asf even tho trick is ez esp if i’m actually rolling. anyways, second slide is kinda funny cause it’s just a picture of me like full malding bc i was ranting about someone. i think everyone on my spam has seen this firsthand, but when i rant i go off. i genuinely do feel all the emotions that i felt during the thing i’m ranting about and idk it’s such a genuine explosion of emotions for me. but i think this is why i say i love hating, bc it’s such genuine catharsis for me. idk feel like a lot of my friends have challenged me on the question of should i hate or is it appropriate to hate? and i think this has genuinely one of the hardest questions i’ve come to face. at one hand hate just spreads negativity but a lot of time hate has done a lot of good for a lot of communities. for example i started watching this skateboard youtuber called gifted hater who i think makes productive hating videos. i think the skateboard community seems really not accepting and hateful a lot, but i think the things skaters hate on has genuinely improved the community by creating more passionate and hardcore members. idk i def do think hating can be a very good thing. and if i get such catharsis from hating isn’t it just simply a good thing? i think hating on ppl is just my way of wishing someone was just a better person. and i think that’s really core to who i am as a person and i’m honestly fown to never let that go. i think i will always rant about some people bc it’s my way of showing my values to the world. also hating gives a lot of independence tbh. like i hate on relationships bc i value a lot of that independence and when i see ppl compromise things that imo are very integral to one, i think it’s horrible. and i will hate. idk but i def think howard has changed my idea of hating on something cause it’s cringe. i’ve def changed a lot of things on like traditonally cringe content. like when</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

_a6-i">bruh first day of school. i straight up don’t want to pull up to like half of my classes. idk just feel super mickey mouse plus i don’t feel like sweating for my classes plus transiting to school is a pain. like bruh phil is like a bruh moment. but i’ll prob will go to my class just so i can workout. back going cray cray. had dinner with my friends it was pre cool but honestly i was super fucking exhausted. it was imagine day and i looked thru all of the clubs with amina and bruh shit was so socially exhausting so when i went to the dinner party i was kinda checked out. bruh haven’t skated for a bit gotta do that. more like two days. but idk, living off of campus feels isolating, def feels like i’m away from the action and there’s less opportunity to make new friends. obv i gotta give myself chances but idk i just thought there would be more opportunities than there actually is. ig i thought clubs would meet more or be more active or idk? but unironically i want to join the birdwatching club, i went to their booth cause i remember nimai was talking about how he can feel birdwatching be his new hyperfixation, and the guy i talked to seemed really nice and genuinely really passionate about birdwatching. unironically a big part of the lack of opportunities is the fact that the majority of my courses are first years, im def hating and just being a pretentious second year but i really don’t feel like talking to first years who are putting a facade cause they’re desperate for friends and first years who are lowkey sweating for uni bc they haven’t been worn down yet. i’m also just not excited for the first year influx at golds. i just want less people at my gym fr. i did like a quiz on math today and lowkey i did kinda mid on my standards. i fr got like 3/5 of the first questions wrong bc i unironically needed to warmup my math skills. once i got into the flow it was way better but fuck trig bc i forgot everything about trig like bruh my ass too lazy to remember the unit circle again and there’s no formula sheet so my ass gotta remember like trig functions like nahhhh. it’s just been too long since i’ve done math gonna be rusty which is unlucky.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202309/375397926_705897557535073_2115701735428606873_n_17997594782116912.jpg"><img

idk man. shit looks amazing. anyways slide two is me trying to 3 stair. lowkey didn’t try it that much cause on that clip i landed hard on my heel and i bruised it yesterday so i was done for the day after that. bruh this heel needs to heal so i can skate. all i fr want to do rn is skate. ong tho i have a lot of motivation to skate just cause zander is with me and he’s really good. idk lowkey i feel less scared to do things bc in my head i’m like “ik zander thinking ima bitch for not commiting cause this is some cake walk shit for him.” and then i actually get confidence cause i just imagine how easy he thinks it is and i’m like “huh it is probs that easy or atleast not that risky to do.” i also just feel less scared at the skatepark cause i’m friends with a guy who’s actually good. ig that’s how people feel when i bring them to the gym. but ye slide 3 and 4 is clips from today. he’s actually good at scootering. buddy will do the most insane shit so casually sometimes and i be like “no way i’m stuck on the manual.” i find that shit hilarious. but honestly i find a lot of things hilarious. like talking to amina and emily the other day i would say the most depressing shit like “karma doesn’t exist there is so many people in the world who commits atrocious acts to others and never will feel a fraction of that pain” and then be like “it’s kinda hilarious if you think about it tho.” i don’t even cope with depressing shit humour its my way of acceptance. like when i talk about my suicide attempt i always laugh or talk about how funny it was or the fact that i got a 96 the essay i wrote in that night (which is so hilarious and absurd) and then the other person doesn’t laugh and it’s lowkey awk. life is fucking hilarious tho, im probably misrepresenting camus work but life is genuinely so absurd it’s funny. anyways, i’ve been doing a lot of hobbies to fulfill my younger self goals (getting gold nova in csgo, getting okay at osu, hopefully kickflipping). i think

slightly better than trash allegations. i haven’t worked out in so long i’m actually really hyped to work out today. but bruh it’s fr been forever. need to lift fr. i also bought another eva shirt. me using my full willpower not to buy an eva shirt (i bought it anyway). i just love eva sm. a part of me feels like i gaslit myself into loving eva, but also i think it’s undeniable the influence has in my life cause legit watched that at my lowest. even if i didn’t understand a lot when i initially watched it i was like i think eps 24 and 25 still really resonated with me. also speaking of, a lot of ppl hate my take when i’m like there’s not enough explicit exploration in art. i def think implicit exploration has its place but i always will prefer explicit. i hate the show not tell attitude of art tbh. even bojack talks about it before free churro and does one of the best exploration of explicism with free churro. and i think eva does it really well in eps 24 and 25. using animation perfectly as a medium to put shinji as a god of his own existence. bruh how did this turn into an eva rant. but i genuinely do love eva sm. and honestly i get why ppl hate it, shinji is pre insufferable and the main reason i relate to him is when i watched it. i also just have a thing for depressed asf characters and when characters are shown to be shaped by their environment. anyways, i went fratting yesterday 😭. got high asf but lowkey still had a mid time. fratting is mainly to talk to random ppl. and it’s pre mid lowkey wanted to have a chill night. but ye. i wish more ppl loved eva bc i love it sm &lt;3. it’s weird asf tho no kap.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

her reminded me of how little time i have left with everyone/how little time we are actually in each other lives. bruh actually sad that summer is coming to a close and how i just won’t be able to see people sometimes. i have such good friends here and this summer has been really good. the best thing about this summer is how my friends have really challenged me, i feel as if this has been the most i’ve grown from others influence. calgary ppl genuinely challenge me way more than van ppl and i’ve honestly come to be a little arrogant in my opinion. honestly i didn’t expect this much from summer, but i got so much out of the summer than i ever thought i would. i grieve a decent amount losing anything but idk def grieving a bit rn. i just wanted to thank everyone for this summer and challenging me, and i wish things could last longer. i think what i’ve figured it out for my meaning of life is expressing myself. maybe this is a bad take bc there’s no one meaning of life (my therapist def kinda thinks this) but everything kind of boils down to expressing who i am. and i think what’s amazing about having friends is each friend allows me to express a different part of who i am. when i think about what i say or what i talk about to my diff friends, it feels like a diff person talking each time but i feel so authentic and present in those moments. every friend feels like a piece of a puzzle to who i am. and i think that’s what being my friend means. tbf i feel as if i have pre high definition of friend, like there’s piss random, my friend ig and friend. but i feel as if you’re my friend if you feel like you are a piece of the puzzle in terms of who i am. but idk, in terms of expressing myself, hobbies are def avenues of self-expression and this spam to. it genuinely does feel as if it is my meaning in life. maybe it’s a little self-centred cause i quite literally described my friends as objects of my own expressions. actually it is. i change my mind. there’s def more to my friendships than ppl that allow me to express, it is a big part of it fs tho. idrk the other part?? it’s hard to describe. maybe it’s</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

competitively has to be one of the most mentally draining things ever. idk most of it is just me hearing about pros bitching about how draining chess is, but unironically i lowkey got anxiety playing in 800 elo 😭. i’ve always had hella anxiety when it comes to competing, badminton mfs know that i’m a beast in training but consistently gets upset in tournaments. okay but highkey it’s not even my fault, pre sure i just did so bad bc i had sm pressure on me and it’s not like my parents set me up for having a good mental. idk chess def feels like something i would be very anxious playing competitively bc every move kinda just has a butterfly effect of consequences. i couldn’t imagine miscalculating a line 3 moves down and losing bc of it or losing bc i never studied a niche and irrelevant line. idk for me tho i just get a bunch of anxiety bc i’ve blundered my queen like 100 times and every time i touch the queen i get scared asf. or when i’m making the checkmating move and the game doesn’t end i lose my shit. idk think it was good to take a chess break tho, just felt tired and right. plus i was kinda hooked on doom eternal, shits fun asf, movement shooters are generally just amazing. idk, felt kinda lonely today so i need to go outside. btw i’m leaving the 25th so i need to hang out with everyone one last time</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

cry. idek why it’s just so fun. anyways, spent the entire day grinding chess and got to 800 elo and unironically it’s all bc of nimai. my mental fucking boomed two days ago bc i was hard stuck like 720 elo and all my losses just felt like me literally putting a piece on a square that was defended by a bishop i didn’t look at across the board. but this nimai guy was like “look, your doing your hobbies wrong” and im like huh you right and when i started prioritizing my fun i think i just got better. i think it’s also perfect timing bc i feel like i just got out of my plateau so it kinda explains the sudden climb. i’m def seeing the game differently rn, i think all the pattern recognition just kicked in and im def better able to understand what squares/pieces become weak after a single move. i also started playing danish gambit on white, and it’s genuinely very exciting to play. i think i haven’t lost on danish gambit. tbh it’s probs just low elo players suck at defending, but tbh defending is hard asf. i also finessed this fucking win by baiting someone into a backrank, and i felt so criminal for doing that. felt proud of myself cause i was like “doing what works in my elo” which is something nimai told me to do. i’m probs gonna plateau around 850 i would say. i def felt this huge improvement spike just bc it literally clicked and i just started seeing the game differently. i def enjoy hyperagro more than positional, but i think my positional has improved a lot bc i play caro kann every game on black. i think what i need to work on for hyper agro is learning when to sacrifice pieces. i just don’t have any pattern recognition for that. i also feel motivated again to start studying endgames and read some chess books, and that just came with me enjoying chess more. i think what’s really hard about self-learning is identifying weaknesses, esp rn just bc i only lost 3 games today. i got lost in equal mid game a fuck ton. like there will be some positions where i will completely just not know what to do bc every move feels losing. defence is def a weak point but improving. lowkey i feel like that’s the</div><div class="_3-95

you just grind you’ll be good” and “everything below 1500 elo is fr just not blundering.” that’s when i kinda realized chess is less about having insane thoughts and coming up with insane moves but just grinding shit out until i recognize the patterns. ig a part of it is bc i don’t feel myself improving, but the only way i feel i can improve is to play more chess. idk man, grinding something just for the sake of it is not fun, i thought chess was actually cool. unironically my fav times playing chess was 400-600 elo, i felt like i was thinking about shit sm and deriving the meta or atleast parts of it by myself. but now it just feels like i just need to learn more just to get better. idk man:/. ig that’s what i hate about alll games, lots of games just revolve around meta which is kinda boring. games are way more fun when it allows you and rewards you to be creative. but maybe my new hyperfixation will be producing music. idk tho. we will see. tbh just excited to go back to

to push yourself hard!!! i think this genuinely explains why i go to the gym. for context: the video is about the sports psychology behind tour de france cyclists and how they’ve been able&#064;to train their mental to treat pain as information instead of pain. generally speaking, noobs to physical activity try to disassociate and distract themselves when they faced with physical pain instead of using that pain as information. i think it’s genuinely insane how i am able to use my skill set of emotional coping that i learned thru therapy and use it for working out. it’s fucking crazy. and it explains so well why i love working out. unironically LOVE PAIN! also i hate mfs that would respond to me saying unironically with “how do you ironically love pain.” you fucking don’t but you still understood what i said no? stop being such a fucking prescriptive linguists and appreciate the ability of the cognition to understand words out of proper context. and appreciate the ability for language to be able to reflect so much personality simply by choosing unconventional words. language is an organism and it’s ability to evolve and provide so many tools to its users is genuinely beautiful. like so beautiful. i’m in love with english because i can create words out of thin air that would be understood. and through these newly created words i can express myself better. i love how much of an idiot i sound. so mald buddy. unironically cry. okay sry language is genuinely beautiful! maybe i should’ve majored in linguistics. it’s all g it’s like a 1/4 of my degree</div><div

forgetting to eat. ong i woke up this morning, watched gm narodirsky speed run videos which is basically genuine educational videos on how to play chess. and than after i finally finish eating my breakfast i start playing chess from like 10-6 non stop no troll. i’ll analyze my games after too. and than at 6 i realized i’m just losing and my head hurts from using it too much. so than i’ll be like time to take a break. and then at like 9 i’ll start craving some more chess and than play two games until i realize my head hurts. and then i will end the day watching more educational chess vids. but today pre sure i lost like 85 elo. which is all good! i might have lost elo but i learned infinite, i genuinely feel like such a better player than i was in the morning and feeling like i have a better grasp of the game. i think i strengthened my openings a lot, have a better understanding of it, my mid game was really weak before and now it’s okay. and i’m way more comfortable playing with a closed centre/having a lot of active pieces on the board. i think the craziest part is that i’m like 500 elo. like bruh mfs be like 2500 elo that means there like 5x better me (probs more). that doesn’t sound that insane but like idk just thinking about how there’s sm more i can learn and how little i really know is insane. i think it adds to the beauty of chess, idk with chess every piece of position feels so intentional. like everything has so many consequences to think about and it’s insane. like idk everything feels so interconnected and every slight positional change has such major consequences. really speaks to the skill expression of the game but also how simply beautiful it is. how can such a simple and old game have such complexity in such simple actions.z everytbing feels so intentional in chess and i think it’s genuinely beautiful. it really does feel like every move is a puzzle and solving puzzles is so rewarding.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a

500 elo now which is pog. feel like i understand chess more in my 0head ways. just gonna keep on learning random skills and doing random things. think i wanna try producing music, i alr pirated fl studio too. so we pogging. just wanna see how that goes. maybe do some leetcode. idk man just open to anything.z but def gonna play less video games, need a break from that fs. i think the one thing i lowkey never talk about on my spam is sex. the only reason i do is bc it’s funny asf (i LOVEEEE making mommy issues jokes) and honestly sex is just kind of funny. like as scared as i am about having sex i think it’s hilarious. but also probs the things i’m into is kind of absurd. the only person i actually talked about it with was lisa bc she kinda made me spill the beans, but honestly it was embarrassing but kind of nice just to finally talk about it. idk i’m def not comfortable around talking (or having) sex bc i feel like every time i’ve had sex i’ve kind of regretted it. actually i kinda realized that when i lost my virginity, angel was lowkey trying to use it to win me back. and i never realized it until now. cause during our relationship she was only comfortable giving me head. and when we broke up we met up for the first time and she teased me hella and when i lowkey told her i wanted to finish she was like “next time we meet.” and the next time we meet she’s suddenly comfortable to have sex which takes me back and i like triple check bc i’m like wtf??? but i’m just a ducking dumbass bc she probs only had sex with me so she could get back together and it just feels kind of manipulative? idk def didn’t get raped or anything but it’s just not the best way to lose your virginity and have that standard for sex. and with tamara i def wasn’t really that comfortable when we had sex, idk didn’t realize how comfortable i needed to be with someone. so ye ig this is the sex rant. i’m pre sure i want to have sex with someone after i’ve been in a relationship for a bit, but i could also</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202307/363816371_6507902629303382_2912657885200107497_n_18015978346674275.jpg"><img

essay i wrote when i tried to kms. and then you’re telling me i get a b+ in phil 102???? like nahhhhh. slide 1 is tacos i ate with lisa, honestly kinda mid but also my appetite was fucked bc of my meds. slide 2 is officially my new pc, i got a new case so everything has been replaced from my old pc. or is it the ship of theseus, when did it become my new pc. or was it always my old pc. who knows! slide 3 is me responding to olga :3. hung out with lisa today, said some embarasssinf ass shit to her. but honestly feels good to finally say some of this shit. umm, reading my old spam posts i forgot how depressed i was. but i just wanted to also say, thank you for being there for me!!! like idk, i do really appreciate all the support you all have given me and you all have had a big impact in my life!! after my attempted suicide (which was the lowest point of my life) the only reason i wanted to live was to see you all again. if i had no friends, i have no idea what i would do tbh. so i really do appreciate it. i also would like to apologize for how unhinged i was. it’s kinda crazy that some of my posts were like “im going to be safe tn but i want to blow my brains out” and how i was lowkey an alcoholic. it was probs def a lot to read and process thru and highley i projected my hopelessness to everyone. so i do really apologize for provoking such emotions to everyone. overall, some days are still bad, but the pain i went thru really was unimaginable and i would have not made it thru it without all of you!! so thank you &lt;3 it’s insane the amount of pain i went thru. literally sobbing multiple times a week, or feeling so empty and not having the catharsis of releases, to literally just shaking from pain. my only resort was to be addicted to tiktok bc the pain i was going thru really feels unimaginable. and even tho i do apologize for speaking about the pain in concerning ways, i also understand why i did it. idk man, i genuinely never wish that much pain for my worst enemies. quite literally lived thru hell.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

that’s about. usually i don’t make posts bc im not doing anything and there’s nothing to write about but todays the opposite. i haven’t been making posts bc i’ve been super busy tbh. just hanging out sm socially which is super fulfilling, think this week has been the most fun i’ve had, but super exhausting. felt so exhausted yesterday but also consumed sm media bc i ended up hyperfizating on this really ass novel. after i spent 8 hours reading 140k words, i was like “damn i could’ve read an actually good novel but i’m reading this shit.” i don’t even want to talk about what i read. also watched oppenheimer yesterday, it’s honestly really fucking mid. the directing is good, some of the scenes are so insane that they do provoke a lot of emotion in you. but the story is just so bad. so boring. none of the characters are likeable. i still dk how opppenheimer is supposed to be likeable or empathized at all. the movie literally calls him out for how unlikeable he is. and then it calls him out again for not really having a stance. the antagonist is just shit, his motivation is just really stupid. like he’s just praying oppenheimer downfall for fun basically. this movie is like legit a 2. the 2 is from how well directed the movie is. okay maybe a 3. i just don’t comprehend how the story is good in any sort of way. it’s not thematically good, it’s not entertaining, like idk? but don’t get me wrong the directing is really good, there’s basically this insane ntr scene that is fucking amazing. but idk, most of the characters don’t have redeemable qualities and when they do, they aren’t explored enough to be empathized with. i feel as if the movie scaffolds a way to empathize with oppenheimer, but never explored it making the movie feel really unfocused. idk. i’m also home alone now. which is cool ig.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202307/362612469_132707216497941_7662397265060869859_n_17994286931086260.jpg"><img

morning and was like do you want to help bandage my horse and i was like wtf. i ended up helping her and hanging out but idk. it’s cool that she puts in effort and shit but also idk if i’m feeling her as much as she’s feeling me. like she’s cool but we’ve like hung out three times this past week and it’s a little much for me. i’m also just not really used to people asking me to hangout a lot. i’ve been watching k-on recently and i really like it. genuinely love female-led/only females slice of life with no boy drama. i think men in casual media are generally v boring. they are just written with less emotions and more mature and boring and it’s cringe. idk not many thoughts today tbh. not many thoughts this summer. ig it’s bc i haven’t been doing too much just vibing. playing lots of video

went on a huge win streak. eepy af tho. bruh i need more balance in my life tho. i feel like in a day i either am out the entire day or i don’t say a 100 words out loud total. both days kinda suck, honestly being out all day isn’t bad but i’ve realized i can’t hangout for a lot of consecutive hours but if i get a break i’m like recharged. so i hung out with arthur, nimai and howard yesterday which was really fun (but tiring cause we were out for a while) and then lowkey i got pressured after to go out and drink a bit with coworker friends. i like them tho tbh. there’s this girl named sarah who brought her bf, and honestly i think she acts in a really flirtatious manner (kinda?) but is too innocent to realize. ik she’s being really friendly and she just doesn’t know, but i’ll get a text from her being like “carsynnnnn” and i be in my head like “dawg relax.” im not saying it’s her fault, but like i’m pre sure one of my coworkers likes her even tho he knows she has a bf. idk tho i genuinely think she just doesn’t know some of the shit she says can be interpreted as flirting. but also her being friendly is nice, she puts a lot of effort of doing things first and she makes sure she knows she appreciates you as a friend. also my ego got boosted bc i gave her my ig and she was scrolling thru my post and she was like “damn these fits are nice” and then she saw the pic of my back and was like “oh shit” and closed her phone and then asked me if i really don’t have sex 💀. she in like disbelief that i don’t got bitches and lowkey ego boosted infinite. idk. okay time to be cringe and talk about why i want a gf now. i think a big part of why i want a gf is bc i actually need daily social interaction. i can’t handle really long social interactions but idk think it would be nice just to talk to someone for a bit daily. thinks this goes with the consistency of having someone that comes in a relationship. 

okay this spam post is really sporadic but a thought i wanted to write down is that i still feel like i’m really self destructive but i</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

another man’s treasure. and it fucking works. so fucking pog. pc is lowkey kinda nice rn. can’t believe it worked, lowkey went thru a beating bc it spent the entire day in my backpack. had therapy yesterday, was pre lit. it feels good to bitch to my therapist. also worked with this girl named sarah dunbar, she has a bf which i highkey dgaf about bc she’s too normal for me. but she’s cool, we actually talked about mental health and it’s been a while since i talked about mental health for a bit. also kind of nice to talk to a girl, i feel like i’ve been talking to so many people who have diff political ideologies than me that it’s finally nice to talk to someone that doesn’t say misogynistic shit. and also was interesting to just hear about the random misogyny she hears, unironically being asian is way easier than being a woman. but lowkey had to carry her in terms of strength for one particular job (and she knows it and apologized) but tbh idgaf bc she tried her best and that’s what matters for me. like mf was not slacking. “to each of their own ability” fr. idk just nice to talk to someone who also goes to therapy tbh. idk overall chilling. okay with going to my job still, we’re gonna see when i want to quit. play that shit week by week basically. last shift was good bc of her, we will see how i feel moving forward. if not will just quit out of the blue.</div><div

other things. i kinda fucked up and my coworker got pissed at me, it was honestly really uncomfortable but i honestly kinda got it just cause we were on our 11th hour with more shit to do. so it was that on top of the minor thing i fucked up. and i think what really sealed the deal is when i got back. this fucking tool coworker named robert thompson had no fucking empathy. fucking idiot fucking white person npc. like buddy i just worked 15 hours grinding my fucking ass off atleast pretend to have empathy. and he’s so fucking incompetent. fuck that guy. i fucking hate him sm. like i go back and im pissed and he’s like “you signed up for this” like buddy i didn’t first of all my contract says “10-12 hours” and are you so fucking stupid that just bc somebody signs up for something doesn’t mean they can be pissed??? like ppl sign shit all the time and they are upset about it??? like buddy is just invalidating my feelings because he’s such a fucking tool. and a fucking sycophant. how tf are you gonna be a fucking tool and a sycophant at 1-800GOTJUNK. sure if you’re in a business company and gonna make bank but this guy can go nowhere in his career there and every mf just hates him bc he’s a tool. FUCK THAT GUY. I FUCKING HATE HIM SM FUCK HIM FUCK HIM. so i just fucking cussed him out and just told him how fucking stupid of an argument that bc “i signed up for it” (which isn’t even true my contract saysb12 hours) i suddenly can’t be upset about it. what a fucking idiot. shit ass 28 year old ugly as fuck no&#064;fucking life direction and worst of all no personality not even a real human being. mf like 6’3 100lbs his spine with crack in half if i just kicked him once. just a fucking tool for 1-800 to abuse and fuck him over i feel ducking pity for that lesser life being. can’t even do the one basic human thing of fucking having empathy. genuinely tho man, it’s so easy to have empathy there, to be like yeah your shift fucking suck, but the beast he can do is say good job you made a lot of money

fun but lowkey i didn’t want to go at the start bc i had an exhausting gym day and had an insane shower and i was so exhausted for like 3 hours. speaking of the gym we went to our local starbucks and i got recognized cause one of the workers goes to westside to. he told me “you’re actually insane” and lowkey i knew this mf is complimenting me and also observing the fact that i actually make a fool of myself at the gym by acting fucking crazy. buddy be slapping myself at the gym. speaking of westside, apparently ernie and grace song go to westside and bruhhh i lowkey don’t want to see them. it’s not even cause i’m like hella jealous, it’s just so fucking awkward and i feel like things were always shaky/awkward/weird with grace. and things kind of ended with me asking if she wanted to catch up and her never following up. they usually go at night so ill&#064;prob never see them but a part of me also wants to go just to lowkey flex on them and act even more insane and unhinged in front of them just to blow their minds or something. i honestly dk what feelings i feel towards grace and ernie, it’s just unpleasant to say the least. idk why i group them together tho, it’s just grace. idk, ig i’m just ready to move on from that part of my life and just thinking about seeing her again feels like revisiting shit. but honestly looking at my history with her, i prob caused a lot of turmoil with her but idk i honestly feel as tho it’s kind of on her just bc she was really bad at communicating. i think i generally perpetuated the problem by how reliant i was on her emotionally and general mental instability, but also that wouldn’t have happened if she made her boundaries clear. tbh being depressed fucking sucks, i was really bad at reaching out for help but at the same time it kind of felt like every time i did i never felt better. it made me feel like i needed to suffer more in order to be deserving of help but honestly i fucking suffered a lot. it’s insane how much i did, i honestly kind of forget. and tbh i feel like i still feel some of the insecurities she perpetuated to this day. i’m still pre insecure about</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

but idrc im gonna leak all of it. honestly, now that i’ve grown up and matured a lot, laurence is really fucking weird and really slimy. idk hback in the day he was honestly really invested in 14 year old drama and shit. like he wanted to know who i liked and shit and general inappropriate (but not down right wrong) conversations i’ve had with him. tbh i can’t remember anything exact anymore but it’s def weird how invested he is in teenagers. moreover, he puts himself as a position of a mentor and he’s fucking really shit at it. the problem that plagues ds is shit mental (kevin shi, easton, me, ethan, kaenna etc.) and lowkey all of the players listed we’re trained/mentored directly by him. not saying he caused me to depressed as shit but he def was a catalyst. and i think that goes with his unprofessional as well, he def oversteps his boundaries as a coach/manager. like buddy i’m paying you to coach me not set expectations and scaffold destructive mental issues. buddy would be so proud of creating such mentally unstable individuals, like i remember how he talked about how one of the players was so scared of losing that he would just win. or how he wanted me to really feel how fucking shit losses feel so i could win (i ended up just getting anxious every time i felt like i was losing). i think along with this his parting with coach huang just has bitter/egotistical marks on it. “it’s not me but our system…. time to fix [the system]” “some of you have seen [results from my coaching]” like buddy do you realize what typa spot you are in. you lost what literally brought 80% of your comp players to ds, coach huang. and to just blame the system and claim you can fix it is absurd. generally speaking, coach huang was prob pissed at laurence but he prob mainly left cause money and shit. also cause laurence used centre ave money to pay for tim’s tuition. i think what gave me the</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

to catch up bc i was just never close to her. and i didn’t really want to talk to her. but i lowkey said yes bc i haven’t talked to a human being in two weeks so i was like fuck it. it was okay. i’m gonna flame her on something really braindead and stupid but lowkey the top she wore was pre ugly and it’s kinda stupid for me how much your fit matters in terms of attractiveness. like it doesn’t have to be outstanding but idk it was kinda bad. but also she’s just basic or normal??? idk we just basically smal talked for the entire time. i have no clue how i liked her at one point, was fr down bad as shit. we just don’t click at all. also i learned about how being manager/working management at any commercial&#064;place fucking blows. apparently you work a lot&#064;of unpaid overtime hours and have to go in on day offs/every holiday. one of the truck drivers was literally manager of this place (and sobeys) but decided to demote himself essentially bc he gets paid more and gets paid overtime. we all fr struggling except&#064;the fucker at the top. also sleep schedule is fucked, stopped playing league at 1:30 and then read a literal lawsuit for an hour. ong reading lawsuits is hella interesting, i always thought the language would be really complex but it’s really readable, i like how they explain relatively basic concepts, it really makes the law accessible. and it’s an interesting read. and there’s hella citations. ong law feels like a academic paper more than anything which i think is really good. but also it was hella entertaining bc it’s literally tea/drama

everyone is a piece of shit is kinda nice. makes them more human. and i like the meta narrative of it all and just the avant- grade nature of the ending. ong tho end of eva is not as good as eps 25-26!!! actually the start of it is pre good but than the end i’m just like ehhh. wtf is going even more but it’s kinda mid now. some girl named grace got my ig. idk she’s based tho bc her bsf listen to bladee. might have to go for her bsf no troll ‼️‼️lowkey i be malding tho bc this girl name joelle that i’m talking to isn’t responding to me and she’s the one who’s actually a schizo. i enjoy talking to her and generally if you say some unhinged shit to me i fall for you. it’s the dumbest way for me to fall for someone but literally just being like “i take antipsychotics” or “i hate my mother” in the first 10 minutes of talking to me is a turn on. ig i respect the realness of it all but it’s prob bad. but also she just seems cool. she’s prob not responding tho just cause it’s hinge, i lowkey hate opening dating apps and interacting with ppl there and it’s way more comfy opening ig. idk this spam account is also bad bc it just allows me to overthink and shows everyone these really cringe overthinking thoughts. also this morning i started malding bc i kinda realized i liked her or atleast have hopes with her. which makes me feel like ass just cause i’m scared asf when it comes to woman!!! also watching eva today made me realize i’m kinda like my dad and that made me want to die a little. idk overall ig i’m talking to woman. need to be social soon and go outside and talk to

schizophrenia and now i feel kinda bad for my response 💀. lowkey thought it was to treat some personality disorder but i forgor. i also wonder how she is like than. but idk. the main thing is she responded fast and now i have hope. it’s insane how shit that kinda makes me feel tbh. my immediate response to having hope or having the possibility of connection is just despair bc i don’t want to get hurt. feels pre bad tbh. and it’s also the same with friendships. when i feel really close and vulnerable to someone i lowkey get a panic attack and start dereakizinf and thinking things are fake. with no drugs and that, like i’m greening out or bad tripping. pre sure irs just my nervous system responding to a perceived threat of being emotionally vulnerable. feels bad man. also watching eva again and it’s honestly pre entertaining. idk some of the eps are honestly kinda entertaining and there feels like a lot of plot to uncover. and ong the first 4 eps are so good. the building of foundation of shinji character is really well done, idk he’s just so relatable to me. him talking to his dad reminds me of my dad and idk misato unironically is such a good example of mommy issues it’s fucked. it gets worse after that but it’ll start going off again soon like eps 20 pre sure. idk sometimes i’m like bro what if i just like eva bc ppl told me it was good but watching it again i genuinely do really enjoy it and find shinji kind of relatable. idk that’s all i will respond to this woman now but i’m like hella scared. nothing scarier in the world like woman giving me hope

literally buying eva merch. but the bottega boots are literally goated, there green and just so weird and braindead that it’s goated. i think that’s the best thing about go shopping with others, back when i used to go thrifting with grace she would impose a lot of her style on to me and encourage me to try new things with clothes or what she considered cool. honestly, a lot of my earliest fits were just her style. but i think whenever you shop with others they will encourage you to try new clothing out and a lot of the clothing that i end up trying ends up some of my fav pieces. and it’s an example here, i think both of this the bottega boots are hard but i would def shy away from the green and he would be like “bro it’s based.” and it’ll def let me experiment with brighter colours and essentially influence my style with his own. it’s nice how collaborative fashion can be from the simplest things. but ye hung out with him for quite a long time, and we literally started philosophizing and shit it was insane. and he really honestly made me question about hating, it’s honestly been a question i’ve had for a long time and i feel as if i need to draw a new line on what i should and shouldn’t hate. but it def needs more thinking. also hung out with stephen which was fun, we just sat afk and played video games, made some quesadillas which were lit. i’ve realized i can’t hangout with others for a long time, but if i get like a 2 hour recharge period my social battery is fully charged. which is good bc both hangouts were pre rewarding. it’s always good to have diff friends bc they bring out diff sides of you. me and stephen just be sitting and gaming while me and howard just be doing some random shit. it’s insane. haven’t really posted these couple of days, honestly it’s cause nowadays i just don’t say a lot more personal shit on here. just not comfortable to do it anymore and i’ve realized i need to keep some thoughts to myself. that’s all tho tired and

it’s literally 3 seconds so it’s easy asf. i might play more but my taiko drum is coming tomorrow so i’m batchesting about that. my therapist yesterday told me to try out dating apps, and it’s ehh. there’s so many white girls and half of them are country girls. it’s horrible. i feel like i’m sifting thru shit half the time, it’s so surprising how many fucking country girls there are. and seeing ppl yk is embarrassing, i saw xincong profile and this girl name aica (grace and salma were in her picture). it doesn’t help that one of my prompts is “don’t hate me if i have mommy issues 😃.” i hate being perceived, like idk shit feels horrible. and it feels worse bc my likes are essentially a commodity, cause i only get a limited number so idk, just feels like such a superficial thing. i actually matched with someone and she complimented my style, she’s kinda mid tho can’t lie and we prob won’t click. the ball is my field to carry on the convo but like idek if i want to. tomorrow morning thing ig. it’s so bad bc i end up just liking ppl i lowkey don’t fuck with, bc they are mildly more interesting than the 99% of others on the fucking app. it’s fucking horrible, everyone is so boring and i fucking hate normal people so much. maybe i should get tantan bc that’s where the asians are, but highkey i feel like i’m gonna see npc but asian this time. which isn’t as bad tbh, instead of mfs listening to country it’ll be k-pop and instead of watching the office they will play val. which honestly isn’t worse. i also hate how some people just answer there prompts, like if you put two truths and a lie (unless all of them are esp outrageous) you are a ducking npc. or if you say you have have “good music taste” and not say what it is like mf, everyone thinks they have good music taste. and speaking of music, so many fucking woman love the weeknd like idk that fucker was so popular. idk dating apps are cringe but before this i was basically not living. literally just doing nothing but atleast i</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202306/FQIoAkMzLBdAQPN0vGphgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17920918064724442" controls="1" class="_a6_o

but also generally, feeling fucking depressed as fuck these couple of days. i think work drains a lot out of me but also the no social interaction is not helping. also my parents aren’t helping. idk if i will ever have a good relationship with my parents unironically. i think i’ve just been consistently getting bad dreams where my dads the antagonist, i think i just genuinely hate him sm. i fucking can’t interact with them it genuinely makes my blood boil. and he also sits in my room sometimes when i play video games and just him sitting there tucking pisses me off. it just feels like he’s invading my space and idk it angers me sm. but idk, i just fucking hate interacting with them. idek why at this point.z it kinda makes me depressed bc it makes me wonder if im&#064;just gonna be

but it’s also bc i feel like my life is fucking shit. i just don’t care about anything it feels like. honestly i kinda feel like i have an insane victim complex or smth, all i want is to be saved. i just feel like ass. also the average voter is fucking stupid as shit. i honestly don’t even give a fuck about voting anymore, i don’t think humanity has enough iq to sustain democracy.

most interesting that’s happened. it’s also like the first time i’ve interacted with a woman in a month (actually she’s interacting with me). reasons why i don’t want to interact with this woman at all: 1. okay i just had to search up with sophomore is and it’s 10th grade. i think i almost threw up. i mean it’s technically legal but the maturity/everything gap between 16 and 19 is fucking cataclysmic. 2. if you look at her account (i did unfortunately stalked her account) she genuinely posts shit like a middle schooler. like i think this is how my humour and my posts were in grade 7. unironically. like she’s such a band kid??? and it’s not even that, she just records sm it’s so weird. like she just has this random conversation recorded and it’s supposed to be funny but it’s hella unfunny and idk???? like this maturity gap is even more fucking insane bc she acts like a fucking child. 3. she followed 2 hours after i followed a femboy acfoubt. like wat. like i just need to contextualize how insane this is. i’ve never interacted with any of the posts on this account ever. so she had to go on femboy.lifting followers and choose me to follow. on an account that has 21 followers, is a spam account and my pfp is not the most flattering pic of me. 4. just why me? like mf you don’t know me, maybe if you thought i was hot i kinda get why (i simp for too many online woman) but like you don’t even know what i look like. idk why i’m writing this whole post, honestly i’m just kinda bored. i think the worst part is whenever i say in my head i need female validation/attention, i think of this situation and feel immediately disgusted.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

stephen. honestly felt okay but when i got home i got the most insane headache. but idk lowkey it was not lit. okay ik how delusional i sound when i say this, but i thought there would be less weird band kids. okay it’s cause it’s called OTAfest and ota is short for otaku which means anime enthusiasts. so i thought there would be some based batchesters (like me!!!!) but instead i’m seeing the same four cosplays, half the cosplays are teenagers doing chainsaw man cosplays and the other half is genshin impact cosplays (which is literally a chinese game and not japanese???) and i go to these vendors and unironically i see such generic posters and art with the same 10 characters, like don’t get me wrong it’s technically good art but it’s just so boring bc it’s not v creative and everything just started blending together. which is kinda disappointing, bc i actually wanted to buy something that i would like but i just kept on seeing the same shit over and over again. unironically i bought a 10 year olds drawing of mewtwo bc i genuinely liked it and i think it’s cute. unironically tho i think it’s just refreshing seeing a 10 y/o draw, just see kids having fun and seeing like very raw and rough drawing is cool. it’s like the maison margiela 1989 show where he let kids walk the runway and do the invites 🤓. okay i’m gonna just sound pretentious here and idrc but it’s just anti-drawing, where none of the rules of drawing are followed and it’s just refreshing to look at when i’ve been looking at the same type of drawings for like 2 hours. also i kinda hope he is more inspired to draw after i buy his drawing. idk, i think i just have a big romanticization of childhood cause i constantly feel like i didn’t live mine and was forced to mature too early! speaking of, i saw 1 misato cosplay and my biggest regret is not getting a picture with her, except she was like 5’2 (non rom my mommy height and not lore accurate) and had a bf (and looked underage) so i was kinda hesitant. honestly it was a waste of $40 but it really wasn’t at the same time. i am the most genuine believer that it’s the people you go</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

specialization which was really sketch, the tldr of the situation is that i fucked up but i didn’t get punished. all my free time has basically been grinding tears of the kingdom, it’s really fun but i don’t think it’s as good as elden ring. i mean it’s just hard to make rewarding combat like elden ring bc they have to make the game easy. also it’s cringe cause some of the characters are actually the most braindead shit, i feel like i’m watching fucking treehouse. anyways i have work tmmrw but i’m prob not sleeping till 12, i took an amazing nap today. like i fell asleep watching valorant (i swear val esports is the best thing to fall asleep to) and i think this is the best nap i’ve had this year no kap. i just woke up so drodgy and i also woke up to good news. and i was just so foggy but it feels so nice to be foggy when i don’t have to do anything bc im just tired and chilling. anyways gn im not sleepy but i feel too drowsy to do anything.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a

out of context joke :(. ye idk, lowkey i don’t fuck with mother’s day or father’s day. i feel like i have an obligation to do something and it just feels like ass bc literally i have no motivation to do something bc i care or want to. and my sister usually forces me to do things. also i think i’m just 10x more upset bc work has started, irs not even intentional i think i genuinely just don’t have the energy to socialize or deal with my family’s bullshit bc all my energy is drained. honestly irs kinda based tho bc i just play video games. i’ll see how long i last on this job, maybe i will say fuck it and quit but we will see when that day comes. these 12 hour work days are fucking killer tho, atleast i make bank on the tips. and my tips should be doubled excerpt in a trainee so i don’t get my full tips. but yeah today i just played tears of the kingdom the entire day. it’s pre fun, the elden ring open world is like 10x more fun to explore bc there’s more stuff. i pull up to the ruins in TOTK and there’s literally nothing. but in elden ring i pull up to the ruins and there’s a whole boss battle with nice loot. still a fun ass game, im taking my damm time playing this game and highley this game is a puzzle game, all the bosses are kind of like puzzles and most of the shrines are too. it’s like hella fucking fun tho, i spend so much time fucking around tryna make cool machines. idk really taking my time and getting the creative juices going on that game.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

based, hes basically just an existential nihilist. basically “we’re fucked there’s no meaning in life but i might as well be happy and have fun.” which is super based and kind of how i love my life. also turns out this 1-800-GOTJUNK franchise is fucking turbo shit! they have shit employee retention and lowkey try to finesse money out of employees. they also have union busted before which is literally illegal. and they just fire people like there’s no tomorrow. usually people stay for a year and leave it’s pre insane. but idk, i was with this aiden guy the entire day and honestly i feel like i click with him. we have the same attitudes about everything, he’s a huge media nerd (albeit a bit of a normie), he loves fromsoftware games and he’s excited to play tears of the kingdom. and he’s just super based. idk it was a fun day with him, i was tryna figure out this guy political ideology and then i looked at his slack profile and it’s a picture of stalin with the ussr flag 😭. shit is so fucking based. and we highley just have the same political ideology and thoughts, just doomer shit. it was just fun talking to him, and he’s just real. he literally told a customer who cancelled bc of price, “ima keep it real just call someone else they will do it for cheaper. i’m just a grunt worker.” fucker is so real. and he’s telling me all the shit about how shit management is, it’s fucking amazing. bro was lowkey ready to quit his job. and we just talk hella shit too, shit was just fun. highkey, if i got every shift with this guy i’m hella down. shit was actually fun spending 10

levels before but idk. i think i can beat elden ring relatively soon. also beat 5 bosses today, only one of the bosses was optional (and still hard as hell). i got to the end game and the end game difficulty spike is pre insane. not that it is horrible, i like grinding bosses. but yeah the difficulty spike is pre insane. honestly there was a chunk of the game where it was really easy, it was like the mid game and it’s prob bc i got this op ass mage weapon. but i switched back to two handed strength cause i’m a chad. anyways idk i’m super tired gonna go to bed gn. gonna gym and then beat

with (i.e idk how tf to write a 500 word essays and how is 3 of them worth my entire grade). i also lied on my spam story, i start work tmmrw bc someone took a sick day and i was like fuck it why not. it’s just gonna be one day hopefully it’s not too horrible. honestly kinda anxious, genuinely not very excited to work such long hours and i feel like i’m gonna burnout by the end of the summer. i think it’s gonna feel horrible knowing that high key i can’t maintain a full time job. like bruh. but maybe not who knows. but idk, really anxious because my ass does not do fucking work. this entire semester i basically have never did school for 40 hours a week, i would do my 15 hours of classes and virtually 0 hours of hw. we will see how it goes tho. also my stomach has been hurting the entire knight and that’s not ticking lit. it’s been hurting so much. my tummy actually hurts so much. also, been fucking GRINDING elden ring. i think i logged a little more than 20 hours these past two days. literally my full time job. it’s been fun, sometimes it can be frustrating bc i have to go on the wiki bc im literally fucking lost bc i didn’t realize there was a turn somewhere. but rn it kinda feels ass bc im like really powerful rn, i finished one of the npcs main quest line and i think i got like one of the most powerful weapons in the game. i changed from strength to intelligence build, so technically i’m a mage now which is cringe but this weapon is so broken. bosses are like too easy rn. but lowkey popped off today, finished an entire npc quest line, and fought 2/7 of the main bosses. but after i beat the game im prob gonna play it again, there’s like hella builds i want to run like sorcerer or heavy load. game is like too lit. bruh i should’ve not asked to work tmmrw my tummy hurts sm rn.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202305/344798016_784051886376492_7576621720915516173_n_17953697039436306.jpg"><img

introverted it’s crazy. i remember back in the day i would always ask ppl to hangout and they would say no cause they didn’t have the social battery and i never understood, but now i feel like i’m the one that’s drained by the end of hangouts. i mean back in the day i just hung out with others cause it’s either that or i would sit at home and be depressed. but my god is my social battery horrible. but ong, my switch is such a good investment. i literally have just been playing the switch with my friends and lowkey it’s so goated, i played like 4 hours of smash with stephen and i don’t think we realized how long we played. game is goated tho. 

i downloaded tinder this morning bc i thought it would be funny to put a bunch of jacked photos of myself and put my bio as “submissive and breedable :3.” i also highkey want sexual validation without having sex! but i hid behind irony like a bitch. but idk the entire time making my profile i just felt like ass and i swiped thru a couple of people and idk im literally just objectifying these people. and it just felt really ass to rate these randoms just if i think they are hot or not. cause highkey too, i try to see what typa person they are based on their photos. and idk, i deleted it after like 4 swipes cause i don’t want others just looking at me like that and it feels like ass looking at others like that. i think i just hate social media, i actually FUCKING hate meeting people over text. maybe it’s been ruined bc of middle school but there’s so many stupid fucking social norms or expectations or idek that come with texting. like highkey, responding instantly is fucking cringe so you gotta respond &gt;1 hour and not over cause your ghosting, instantly seeing a message is cringe, there not interested in you or playing “hard to get” if they take &lt;1 hour to respond, what emojis do i even fucking use (never use 😂, but like your behind on the trend if you use 😹, you’re mentally ill if you use :3 i could go on fucking forever), exclamation marks always seem sarcastic !! okay some of these are piss</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202305/344355365_1384006852444745_4476420102090051343_n_18194702230301071.jpg"><img

bosses, and i wanted to upgrade my weapon a bit so i went exploring. than i got distracted and went to this dungeon that was supposed to clear by someone with +20 levels. but it was kinda ez and then i got to the boss and i was like bruh this boss is not +20 lvls i can beat it. keep in the mind the whole reason i’m on this excursion is to beat a boss that’s my level. so i grind the fucking boss for like 1.5 hours and i beat it, shit felt good. and then i get my drops and i see i got another fucking scroll. bro i’m getting like way too many fucking socereybitems it’s like too cringe. anyways, i finally go back to the boss i was gonna beat, except lowkey it took me a hour even bc the boss just tilted tf out of me. but highkey, good day of hades. beat the game for the first time and i have been lowkey consistently getting to hades 1 heat. bruh literally nothing in my life is going other than video games. idek what to talk about i’m literally talking about elden ring while you guys probs dk wtf is going on. super tired from video games tho. elden ring was tilting tho today. the second boss was just so aids. also the game is kinda aids cause there’s so many things that one shot, and all bosses basically two shot. i think that’s just cringe, i don’t mind difficulty but artificially making difficulty through one shots is cringe. that’s lowkey what bullet hells and hades does good, makes you feel like every death is deserved. sometimes i just be bitching about dying</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

played 7 hours of elden ring today. honestly not even that much. also my computer runs it surprisingly well, there’s occasional lag spikes at high settings at around 45 fps but on medium no lag spikes 55 fps which is pog. and holy fuck is the game fun, i think the one thing that gets me hard about gaming is exploring. mf i love exploring, playing open world games is so fun bc i just be perma exploring the map. actually only well made open world games. but the game is so pog, there’s no dead ends, just places where it’s like too hard and then your like okay bet i will go a different direction and see what’s there. and that’s insane like i love just how free i am. except i’m also braindead bc i put sm levels into strength bc im like haha im going to use a great sword bc big sword go boom. except now i have no hp and i’m too heavy so my rolls are slow which is fucking aids. but yeah i love fucking exploring and im just playing this game perma exploring and it’s so fun. and the game is beautiful even on medium. and also the fantasy rpg part of the game is so cool i feel so badass and it actually feels like i’m in the world of elden ring. idk elden ring is too based of a game is sm fun just playing the game. if anything this gets me excited for the new zelda game, like bruh it’s gonna be more exploring in my life. dude i love gaming, lowkey it fucking clicked, fuck multiplayer games, it kinda gets lonely gaming by myself but i’m perma down to play some really well made single player games. i literally have too many games im playing, i still gotta play hollow knight and hades. but my god is elden ring fun. like genuinely, i look at the time and im genuinely surprised so&#064;much time has passed. the game is so much fun and it feels like no time has passed but it turns out it’s 4 hours later. bruh idk i love gaming!!! exams were so worth it cause now i can game</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

my pc and this bitch is running kinda nice. it’s pog crazy how nice my pc is running and i feel so good playing on it. so&#064;i am extremely happy about that. ig this will be my reflection post. honestly had a good year, learned lots about myself and unironically learning to love myself. i made one friend with zander and honestly i’m pre grateful for that. but it’s kinda cringe how much i emphasize that idea, probs put like hella pressure on him. but idk i’m really happy i’m friends with him, the longer i knew the more i realized how similar we are. one thing that really frustrated me in hs a bit was how i was a huge nerd but also wanted to be wild and do normal things. like i be sneaking out to my sneaky link while during the day i’m lying in the bed thinking about how goated nge. and i think with him it’s a nice balance between nerdiness and like being wild which is cool. but idk, it’s just nice talking with him, unironically i feel like we have a lot of the same views bc we both are in therapy. so our outlook on life is the same. and honestly i kinda realized to that with any relationship a lot of the meaning is with actions you do. and idk i feel honestly pretty good when i feel like a supportive friend and i think one of my biggest strengths is how non judgemental i am. like i just tell the situation how it is but idk i think i am still able&#064;to be supportive. but idk i’m actually really happy that i have made one friend. like it’s honestly pretty good, my definition of friend is very exclusive and i think getting one is a lot of progress. idk generally, just tired today, went to bed at like 2 last night bc i was busy moving and woke up at 6:30 to catch my flight. all good</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

kinda braindead bc lowkey i wasted the first half of therapy. but also it’s really bad that i think im like wasting it, i think i should just talk about whatever comes to mind tbh. anyways, umm really hyped to be done tmmrw, gonna be leaving super soon and that’s not lit! honestly, only made one friend this year but it’s honestly all good, i think im pretty happy with one tbh. also talked with emily rees and amina today. i say this every time, but im so close to amina it’s kinda strange. but it was honestly a good conversation, it really felt like i was a 30 year old mom talking to their friend group about how they grew. but idk, we were just talking about our semesters and how we grew and changed and it was honestly really good. tbh feel like emily has grown a lot and i didn’t really like her before but after the convo i kinda had more respect with her. but also it’s actually unbelievably nice talking to people ik from western, i think i’m a lot more comfortable bc i was so vulnerable to so many people that i can just say whatever. it’s also the familiarity. like having this conversation feels so nice bc it’s comfortable with ppl im comfortable with. and i also just can say unhinged shit, like i literally told emily that i saw ronin at a party and he was like “fuck emily” and i was like “yeah! fuck emily.” and i just don’t give a fuck. and i don’t think she did either cause i was drunk and i was just so upfront about it. idk it’s nice being unhinged like that. emily also told me that i actually seemed a lot better and lighter which is pretty insane. idk, that convo was actually really nice i can’t lie, just reflecting back on the semester and how we’ve changed is insane. it’s also nice cause i got to hear ronin and emily drama. anyways, i played hades all day instead of studying and yesterday i played hollow knight for the entire day. this morning i was like, “i’m gonna play hades instead of hollow knight bc if i play hollow knight im not gonna put that game down” but</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202304/342944375_571576688403734_5044993730873372367_n_17953299536590607.jpg"><img

princess no? im too big no kap. but actually it’s becoming a problem, a bunch of my oversized comfy clothing is no longer oversized, im beginning to fill the frame for a lot of my clothing. and lowkey that’s not lit cause i kinda hate this look. like i’m not tryna be braindead, but on my main post i look kinda fat cause i’m lowkey just kinda big. like i love how my body looks but i rather be a skinny mf with clothes on. maybe gotta start wearing some vetement hoodies frfr. spent literally the entire day studying for psych. i think i went insane. i didn’t even finish studying, my exam is tmmrw so i’ll study in the morning. it’s cringe cause there’s like a balance between the amount to study day of exam and making sure i’m not working myself to exhaustion. wait bruh i need to study a little more today fuck my life. that’s too cringe fuck. i actually hate studying day of exam but fuck it ig. fuck it im too tired. i also love death grips. after this exam i’m fucking chilling tho!!! anyways, i need to get fucking railed no kappers. okay idk what i’m saying, im so exhausted and i feel so braindead. i also need to go outside, haven’t gone outside last two days cause been busy grinding. also really hyped to go back to calgary, my cpu is coming late which is not lit cause i can’t upgrade once i come back (bc of this alex guy being stupid asf). but i’m excited to see everyone! i want to see all my friends again and honestly, i want to go outside more this summer. but also i want to play hella video games the duality of man. and workout hella. idk we will see!sleepy and tired and not ready for final!</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202304/342231175_2218151098377236_8915820178611301496_n_17973925898491361.jpg"><img

bruh i always expect 0 ppl to comment but so many random comments. like dola always comments on my post it’s crazy idk why. but i support but lowkey i be commenting on 0 ppl posts it’s braindead. and then hella ppl be commenting on mine. like this person named jazz comments on my posts, i haven’t interacted with that woman since middle school. and livia commented, i know howard malding over that no kap! but idk, it’s so weird how so many people comment on my posts it’s like braindead. like i literally was never friends with livia, we only interacted a couple times in middle school. like obv i’m thinking too deep about this, but like why tf are these lowkey piss randoms commenting. like i appreciate the support and that, but idk it’s so surprising. but it’s highkey kinda nice tho i can’t lie! or judy yang, i don’t think i’ve ever had a fucking conversation with her. like genuinely i’ve never talked to this woman in my life and she was the first one commenting. like wtf????? like who are you? or olga im literally roasting this woman in my spam account!!! bruh it’s crazy ig. like it’s dope asf bc yk they commenting just cause and not out of obligation. but like idk i’m genuinely surprised. i think i’m just so surprised bc i hate commenting on posts and i never return the favour. all goodge ig. anyways i’m outing myself as a femboy ig now! i’m like too postironic tho i’m pre

my therapist says i’m burnout which feels like such a fucking stupid and dumb thing to say considering i don’t do work at all. but it’s true just bc i’ve just been so unfulfilled this entirety of first year. on top of all the random stress i have to deal with like, finding a job, worrying about finals, moving out etc. but i’m def burntout bc of just a lack of fulfillers. i’m genuinely grasping straws on why i should even study for my finals. and i’m just so disappointed with how the semester went. i don’t really feel a connection socially to anyone tbh. and it just feels like fucking ass. and i can’t even discern if that’s my fault or not. i just don’t know. i’m pre sure it’s not really my fault, im pre sure i did the best i could but you think trying for so long to be fulfilled with social connections i would be by now. but idk, i don’t feel like i have a support system either, people that are there for me idek if i’m really comfortable with them. i might call my sister and i might talk to amina im not sure tho. i just feel like ass nevertheless. bc idk what to do to make my days fulfilling. i feel like i should i go to the gym today but i’m really grasping draws at my motivation. and i just feel so fucking unfulfilled with everything. also im pre sure i didn’t get the job and the worst part is no fucking cope, i have no clue if it’s a bad thing or a good thing. bc idek what if i want a full time job this summer. it’s a bad thing i got rejected but idk if i’m up for a job once i get back considering how fog shit i feel. but i also dk what the actual fuck i’m doing this summer. i feel so fucking depressed again, and i feel like i’m falling back into previous patterns. my bed is like a trap again and idk. like obv i’m v far from being actually suicidal again but i def feel more suicidal, but i just feel so far from finding meaning in my life and i feel so fucking ass about it. like why? i’ve realized i have kinda romanticized and rationalized my suffering bc it gives my suffering purpose. like somehow my suffering gives me value as a person. bc realizing that my suffering</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

tbh when i see her in the cafe, i always kinda want to talk to her bc we just both bitch to each other and i feel like i don’t have to play an image. quite nice and idk it’s surprising. i had econ today and we had this debate for and against government intervention. was pre braindead but i just went up there and just started hard trolling using random economic theory to make really dumb points. was just tryna satiricalize capitalism and it’s values but idk it was just me being braindead. i also feel like i just can’t be genuine, being ironic is such an easy way to prevent criticism. it’s easy for me to debate points when i seem like a fucking dumbass. idk i’m actually too ironic/post ironic, it’s honestly a really easy way for me to prevent people from being genuine and it’s easy to get easy validation bc im funny and i don’t have to put myself out there. but either way, im sad i didn’t talk to my standardized time table more, they seemed pre cool tbh. wish i did. and after my prof literally told us this was her last class and she got fired, made me so fucking sad and idk. i was honestly really upset, she was really sweet and genuinely very cute, and she literally always gave us candy. and it also made me realize, damn first year really has ended and everyone ik i won’t be seeing. which is just really sad tbh. and seeing one of my fav profs getting fired just hurts. i’m still upset thinking about it too. i really do actually want her to do well, she is genuinely one of the sweetest people i’ve met, she reminds me of mr. freeman. idk, there’s something i genuinely admire with genuine sweet people, and teachers that have this childlike passion to teach. it’s so rare to see someone so genuine, and it really does warm my heart when i see someone emulate that thru their job. i’m actually super upset still fuck. also, was talking to one of my friends, and he started talking about how some gym girls asses are too jacked and that he doesn’t like how it looks. honestly, wasn’t paying attention before but this statement kinda pissed me off</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

soon. which is just a pain in the ass. not fucking excited at all to grind but whatever. just super fnot fucking excited. had therapy today, and just bitched. i was really anxious cause idk if i getting my garbage man job, been getting ghosted which is like turbo not fucking lit. also got ghosted by this other interviewer, think im just fucked. so that just made super fucking anxious. rn is just so aids, i have finals to worry about, moving out, finding new housing, going home, finding new job, and how summer is gonna look like to worry about. and it fucking sucks i hate worrying about all this fucking bs. and it’s honestly stressful. idk. and when i feel so emotional, i just feel like i just want a relationship. as always. i mean idk don’t have really anything to keep me stable, not even gonna sleep in the same bed in two weeks. literally nothing in my life is stable and it’s absurd. i also don’t love anyone (not really) so it’s cringe. genuinely, told my therapist that i feel like everything in my life would be significantly better if i got a gf, and i expected her to be like “no that’s not the case friendships and other fulfillers can make life better” but she just agreed. which was honestly nice. it makes me feel less shit about how i always yearn for a relationship. and i’m so close to a healthy relationship, i just need to wait and find someone which is just so aids. idk, just so close to being way happier but never am. so fucking cringe. wish i had something in my life. things i’m living for: 1. can’t die bc waste of how jacked i am 2. can’t die cause need to be submissive once 3. need to play elden ring 4. need to play botw 2 5. need to cop grail fashion item</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

out is like busting a fat nut, it kinda makes sense cause like your tired asf in both scenarios, but there’s so much norepinephrine in your brain that you feel like your in heaven. genuinely, i feel like so happy and so content when i reach that state. cause it lasts&#064;sm longer than busting a nut, post but clarity hits in like 20 seconds. okay anyways, uhhh i thought about a random theory today. maybe this premise is wrong, but generally men consume more visual porn while woman consume erotica. this is just a tendency tho. i think the reason is evolutionary, generally speaking woman have more oxycontin (love hormone) so it generally makes sense why they consume erotica. but also, it kinda makes sense to that evolutionary men try to impregnate as much woman possible while woman try to look for a mate with a man who will not leave. hence, woman have an emphasis on the relationship and development (erotica) while men just want to bust a quick nut. this is also v subjective and there’s prob a bigger sociological factor. but i just thought about it. also this is phrased like shit so hopefully i didn’t say some misogynistic ass shit. uhh, im lowkey getting ghosted for my jobs, not fucking lit i would be like super sad cause i have no job then. that would not be lit. also, i can’t kms nowadays bc like it would be such a waste for this body to decay in the earth. like i worked too hard and i’m just like too sexy to die no? also im getting progressively more sexually frustrated on this spam which is bad bc i feel like i talk about sex all the time. it’s not good ig. mainly it’s prob boring asf to read. but lowkey i think about sexual fantasies like too much it’s so fucked. i have so many sexual fantasies it’s like really braindead tbh. at this point i’m like too honey might just download tinder and post my body. but idk if i want sex maybe the attention would be nice. if i got any :o</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

actually do my assignments and study for my finals. speaking of doing my assignments, i didn’t do them today. and i needed to finish them. so i’m too fucked. i was working but than i ate food and i got so tored and lazy. it’s okay maybe i will grind them tmmrw. i’m just too sigma nowadays, i literally don’t go outside. like honestly, this week the only reason i go outside is to eat in the cafeteria or go to the gym. i don’t go to my classes. i just don’t do shit it’s crazy. valorant grind is too insane. but hanging out with my sis tmmrw and hopefully i will actually put some balance into my life and hangout with friends. not excited for the summer, i think i have a summer job that’s literally taking out junk, but it pays $17 but apparently there’s tips and bonus pay which equals around $22-$24. so i’m kinda down. it’s 4 days a week 10-12 hours which sounds unironically so fucking aids. like i would wake up at 8, get to work at 9, get off at 7, go home at 7:30, eat till 8, take a shower till 8:30, sleep at 11. i have like 2:30 hours of free time. compared that to me rn, i have 16 hours of free time and 8 hours of sleep. but how do i fit the gym into that schedule. so aids idk if i can do it. which is so bad no? lowkey i put this onto myself bc im actually really scared i won’t be able to work 40 hours a week. like i don’t do 40 hours of schoolwork. i go to my 15 hours of classes and turn off my brain. and maybe do 1-2 hours of hw a week. it’s just too braindead. also! it’s too fucking annoying how there is no way to say “i don’t care” without sounding passive aggressive. like i literally just don’t care about a lot of things but when mfs here me say idc it sounds like i care. esp when i say it in an idc tone. it’s like too fucking cringe tbh. also the bdsm test is weird? it’s just who is willing to unironically be a sex slave 24/7. it’s so hedonistic but actually it just goes against every single value. your life is literally just solely sex??? like you just live for pleasure and die? okay than. like you have to have 20 iq to actually completely partake in that, like i kinda get if you just had</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

it’s too embarrassing no? but tbh i do think my essay is shit, but i genuinely do think the initial criticisms to my essays was like turbo shit. but at the end of the day even tho the criticisms are different, they both tell me the same thing, don’t use such a hard situation and use a dog shit easy philosophical theory for your argument. like bruh, the biggest problem with my writing (and uni) is that i think i have to write some complex ass shit to get a good grade. so i try writing some crazy shit but than it’s just not v clear. and it’s like too cringe. like it clicked for uni. uni is like 10x more braindead than hs, but i just over complicate it by thinking it’s more sophisticated. same thing with writing, writing is basically a multiple choice test but you don’t get the answers. you just have to find the answers for yourself and fill out the criteria. so all you gotta do, is be braindead asf and write a braindead easy essay that just checks out the criteria. essentially i’m braindead. or i’m coping really hard bc i did badly on my essay. but idk genuinely, feel like all i learned was to use an easier philosophical theory. and just make braindead arguments. and just be uninteresting. bedge but i need a good grade. also im phoning it in too hard i don’t even go to class anymore</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

what the “antagonist” motivations are. and the mc is just so too insufferable until end of s2. i do like his slow progression tho, it’s pre insane looking back at his progrsss and seeing how far he went. but he has this insaneeeee conviction that he’s worthless and better off alone just bc he got rejected by a girl from middle school. like pussy is legit thrown at him and he rejects it bc he is self destructive cause he got rejected in middle school. like it was too frustrating to watch. but it was good bc the characters are cute and the two mc get together in the end and that was really cute. also it’s fucking rom com and anything they did rom com stuff i was like “time to add that scenario to the fake scenarios in my head list.” also the teacher is too much of a fucking baddie, i fr need me a 30 year old woman who has a power dynamic over me and abuses me !!! fr tho these mommy issues are too insane, every mom in this anime i lowkey had a crush on. this is like too cringe no? okay but honestly today was a really bad day, i think i just feel so extremely dejected that i am alone and don’t have a relationship. makes sense i felt those feelings climbing up yesterday. so ig today was the climax and idk felt like shit the entire day, felt really lonely but that’s just how it is. my emotions cycle like this. and it makes sense, i genuinely do think i need a relationship bc a lot of my needs aren’t being met and i really do want to experience one. it’s just my body telling me that i’m not completely satisfied with everything. life is not that bad tho, i just needed this day to feel like ass tbh. i really do want a gf. it kinda kills me inside that i prob won’t find one for quite a while. going back to calgary is def not good and when i do find my future gf (which is gonna take a while) it’ll be like a long time before we’re in a relationship. idk, ig it’s not good to think about things like that but i’ve just been alone for so long it’s frustrating to think that this is how</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202304/339196551_1263766227543940_4995612240903713403_n_17972859557188500.jpg"><img

a bunch of friends that support him for no reason. also im watching a rom com so i can see dumb dynamics but it’s really cute and i can be like omg!!!! soooo cute i ship!!! and there’s not a lot of that. been playing a lot of val but lowkey gonna quit, sick of the game no kap. i also can’t grind something for too long, just feel like i need to go back to my routine. also didn’t take my meds today bc i woke up too&#064;late and ended up doing nothing. also i realized it’s too easy for me to form parasocial relationships bc i idealize girls too much. so i’m trying not to do that rn! idk haven’t been doing much these past couple of days. i think esp today i just really want a crush or a gf to do cute things with. like unironically bruhhh it’s crazy how you can get a gf and go on dates and stuff. like i could call up my gf and be like you want to walk on the beach and that is literally a date. or we could just cuddle and chill. like i’m not even saying that bc i’m in desperate need, im saying this bc this idea is so shocking to me. like it’s fucking insane thinking that like half the population doesn’t sleep alone and sleeps with somebody cuddling. like mfs here i love you everyday???? like i heard my sister say that to me and i started crying like bruh. like people actually go on dates and stuff. like there are people who go to the gym with their gf???? like whattttt. that just can’t be real. or people have passionate (or kinky) sex everyday comfortably. all these ideas are very insane to me. or people coming home to their partners and being embraced by them. or texting them throughout the day. like genuinely relationships can’t be real this is a government psyops. like this shit sounds so fake to me, im not even deeply craving it im just shocked that this is a reality some people live. not even jealous tbh. bc to be jealous requires the ability to have the capacity to emotionally understand these experience but all i am is shocked. i am so far removed im not even jealous.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202304/338609740_946422819822542_6446041059401950174_n_17900480432769785.jpg"><img

and have done 0 hw and i haven’t taken my adhd meds bc i wake up so late that i feel it’s not worth to take them. so i’ve been putting bare minimum at life, and phoning it in, barely even eating yesterday bc im too lazy. so i have no photos to show i’ve lived life and im too lazy to find a funny meme bc of&#064;how hard i’ve phoned it in. but this happens and tmmrw i will not let this happen again and i will wake up for my 9am and start my day successfully and catch up and start doing my hw. i did 15% on both my midterms too which is actually kinda crazy and kinda expected. actually not really i thought i did good on one of them but the other makes sense. it’s all good just will pop off in final but also damn kinda unlucky. also it’s weird how i did 15% worse, it’s mainly that i did really good on my first midterms. and tbh it’s not even cause i be phoning it in, it’s just unlucky. anyways, what’s so crazy about me is that i genuinely do really want a relationship constantly, ever since i’ve made this spam account. but every couple of months or so, im really happy i’ve been single for so long bc i feel as if it’s helped me growth. it’s so weird how i can feel so conflicting on something. but now i’m glad i’m single bc idk how it would go down if i didn’t really know my gender and i was in a relationship or my sexuality. i mean it would ideally go down well in a relationship i actually like but i’m also kinda glad i’m single bc i feel like i can discover more about myself. i think i do have this misconception where ppl don’t change in a relationship but idk, it seems really scary to me to be in a relationship where people change. what if people change and it stops working? ik relationships do work and ik why but it’s just so crazy to me. i feel like i can’t even recognize my 15 year old self anymore. it’s scary but every memory i have before my attempted suicide feels so weird. i have no emotional attachment at all and i can’t even understand or comprehend who i was. it’s so</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202303/338119246_141611438856491_3094299426053461665_n_18041036941439350.jpg"><img

chilled in my room the entire day. but it was kinda nice ngl. was relaxing and shit. but i def should’ve done something today. instead i completely phoned it in and did nothing. idk i have nothing to really say today. bc literally nothing has happened since i last posted. oh lowkey this spam account is being used to express me being a silly girl!! bc i am too nervous to do it irl and scared &gt;.&lt; so i’m soft launching girl carsyn on the spam ^_^ also it just kinda seems ironic a lot of the times so it doesn’t matter. but idk i really wish i was born a girl. like sometimes i genuinely think if i was born as a girl i would be more comfy in my gender. but than i go to the gym and see my muscles and then i realize i love testosterone. maybe that’s how it will be, i’ll make my clothes

droppers in a row finishing with the bar and i actually got fucking FINESSED out of a $100. it was decided based on line cheering but after the democracy didn’t choose me (ultra madge) the guy hosting and gym influencer (he has clout so he has to be right) &#064;damianthefatass said that he thinks i should’ve won. unironically, if anything he was watching most intently plus this guy has been training for forever so he knows effort when he sees it. so basically, i got fucking finessed out of a $100 for fucking free no kap. but in all honestly i think i actually did try really hard and idk if the guy hosting thinks i did like i feel as if that says enough. okay i sound so salty and egotistical but ye, literally lost $100 for fun. and like the top 3 fucking suck. i actually almost passed out too. un fucking lucky. anyways, hung out with my sis yesterday, confronted her about her treating me like lil bro too much (fr tho it was hella annoying cause she just treated me like i was 12 sometimes). it actually went really well. i actually cried a little bit bc she was really sweet and said she loved me the most out of everyone in her life. which kinda makes sense cause it wouldn’t be our parents but idk made me cry bc that’s just crazy to hear. just made me really emotional cause idk it’s weird having someone love you. also i told her idk if i love her back bc tbh, i have no fucking idea what love is. like idek who i love or if i love. i also dk anything tbh, my gender, my sexuality or if i believe in family. all ik is democracy is shit and i should’ve won a $100. the people in power should be making decisions (and ppl with clout no kap!) okay sry for being salty, idk it was honestly a really nice moment and i feel like i shouldn’t even be saying it on the spam. but also, it’s weird i feel like for some reason i’m the most loved person in my family. well my dad probs thinks that bc i’m a boy and chinese culture and my mom probs think that bc she raised me

more like a girl! okay but in all honestly i kind of realized, i don’t like showing skin. idk it’s kinda weird im jacked but wearing revealing clothing is uncomfy. and generally girl clothing reveals a lot of skin (crop tops, botty shorts etc). but idk i really don’t like revealing skin. maybe once in a while. i think a lot of is bc i have a v masculine body (which i sm v proud of) but i don’t think it represents me v well. like i love it but i am not insanely masculine and i don’t like being big tbh. which sucks but i also love working out so i’ll make it work. if anything i use my masculine body as a mask (haha wordplay) for my feminine personality. like it prevents me from receiving criticism about being girly bc im more jacked. tbh i wanted to wear a wife beater with my skirt to be like omg! contrasting masculine and feminine outfit. but i think it’s more so bc people can’t critique me for dressing like a girl. anyways, i really did love how the skirt looks on me, it makes me look cute and pretty and idk it was nice :3. the pics don’t do it justice cause lighting is shit. i don’t think i’m trans tho cause i’m fine being a guy and kinda prefer it. i think i just want to be cute and pretty like a girl. gender and sexuality are such weird things, i feel like everyone tries to make categories and generally there are, but i kind of think of everything as a scale. like i’m in my character select screen. its just weird how there are so many categories but in reality everyone’s sexuality and gender is so unique to them. i think categories are good to generally represent yourself but i feels as if society has exaggerated the categories instead of emphasizing that everyone is different and you should express who you are. but idk maybe i’m just a girl in denial &gt;.&lt;. i think it’s just more repressed rn so i express more privately. anyways idk wearing the skirt made me really happy. maybe i’ll buy some women’s clothing or smth. lowkey, i want to go to the mall with a girl and look</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202303/337321312_872913267105065_7747087697547869103_n_17978458075916996.jpg"><img

bc im lazy. essentially, i encouraged one of my friends to breakup like a week ago and this girl fr a crazy ex. like yandere typa shit. after the first day she literally told him she skipped all her classes to stalk him from 9-5. so this woman would just watch him go to class and then just do nothing until next class? bruh shit is so absurd. and she would say all this manipulative shit. and then friday night she apparently got raped (this is probs not true bc of alibi but also i don’t want to say that bc it’s important to believe survivors) and everyone in my friend group was like chilling in her room supporting her. but then she’s like insistent that it’s only zander that stays with her and zander doesn’t want to do this but eventually they’re in a room together and she does not talk about what happened to her and insists that they get back together (which is also probs a manipulation tactic for her and it’s probs fake). so he removes himself from the situation. and then he finds out she cheated on him the first day they were exclusive (which is so irrational and ridiculous) and she finds out bc tamara and her friend snitched to her. so this gf pulls up outside of zander’s door and like begs she gets let in. eventually zander starts a voice recording and like opens the door very shallowly and i heard this recording and this mf is fucking gaslighting her balls off. she barges in and then she just starts making shit up like “ik you said that i would be better off dead” honestly gotta give it to her she’s a good in the moment manipulator. generally tho, she is so shit at macro manipulation. her micromanipukation insane tho. and then her bsf pulls up and is lowkey so done with her and is just bitching. and a bunch of us pull-up and we’re just listening to the voice recording and talking about what we should do to zander’s parents (which is kinda funny idk). and then sophia apparently pulled up to zander’s room and was like listening to us talk thru the door, and

don’t i’m very not horny but i really want someone to kiss me bc i think it would feel really good while i’m high. but also i just want a companion to love me and that. but also fuck that ! i need to spend more time talking about you guys. idk man! friendships are so weird. it’s so weird how we don’t talk and then suddenly when we’re in the same town we will. and it’s all good again. i think friendships are so weird bc it’s so intimate without being intimate. like idk all the close moments are just regular friendship stuff? it’s so weird how some people that are not very involved in your life mean sm. and you banter and it feels okay. so idk i still want a gf but the friends i have rn on this spam probs not reading this post actually mean a lot to me. when i was at my lowest i thought i wanted a gf but honestly i’m glad i didn’t have one. would’ve probs just been a real mess bc i was figuring sm out in my life. but i’m really glad i had a lot of the friendships then. they really did help me. i dick ride this guy a lot but lowkey howard helped sm when i was at my lowest. we never talked about emotions but he was actually just there. ready to be my friend. and just hangout with me or talk with me. and i think that’s what bojack made me realize this time. how important friendships are. so thank you guys. for just bantering with me. or being there. even if you weren’t even that involved, i think just being a friend and making the day better was enough. idk. i’m also high but ye. been thinking about that a lot. all my words fail me rn bc i’m high.</div><div class="_3-95

girl in a lot of my classes and ig it’s a nice gesture. but i can’t lie i really didn’t want her to sit with me bc i just woke up from like a 2 hour nap and it was like those insane naps where you wake up and you forget who you are. so i was so disoriented and i just wanted to eat. but after we introduced ourselves she went on her fucking phone and that gave me the biggest fucking ick. generally going on your phone while we are hanging out irl is just an ick but she literally sat down in front of me (to what i assume is to talk to me) so she should be like making conversation and not distracted. like i kinda view it as like you invited yourself to talk to me and your going to go on your phone? like bruh. anyways she stopped and our conversation was shit, i couldn’t really make convo bc i was so disoriented but also she just sucks at making convo. like ig props for going up but if your going up to talk to me you should be making a lot of the convo bc again, your the one inviting yourself to talk. idk i also realized after this entire convo i had with her im just like “this is what the girls i idealize in mind must feel like after i talk to them.” gave me hella perspective it’s so strange how dichotomous the emotions are between two people. but also ig it’s nice to think this woman had a crush on me and went to talk to me. shit was ass convo but idk ig it’s nice to think about. i should also respect the fact that she went to talk to me probs took a lot of courage. and she caught me at a really bad time too i genuinely was so disoriented. and i basically did a bunch of studying and hw for the rest of the day disoriented and im fucked for my econ midterm tmmrw bc i studied but none of the material registered cause i just feel so disoriented. anyways, one of my friends is going thru a breakup. idk just being sick a hater it’s kinda fucked. anyways just super tired and shit. have midterm. gn all! sleepy af</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a

second and third slide show how i dress vs what’s hiding beneath. cause idk . been binging sm bojack, binged an entire season yesterday. but uhh, im over being on youtube and twitch all the time. all my fun will be attempted productive fun where i play video games or sew or consume media. i feel as if there is sm i want to do in this world and i don’t have enough time but when i do have time i sit and watch youtube instead. so fuck that. i’m gonna start trying to make my fun as fun as possible. so no more youtube. but it’s gonna be hard cause i be tired a lot. i also need to finish the skirt. okay that’s 100% gonna be done this weekend i just have a lot of hw. lowkey it’s not a lot but i need to get it done. and it’s the most i’ve done. anyways, i think i might’ve made a new friend, he’s in my group and i think we click. not too sure tho maybe we’re just both nerdy. but also i might lowkey just try to like make his friends my friends, probs not idk but i was like we should hangout outside of cogs and idk maybe it’ll work out. also talked to this girl i met in my cogs class but lowkey i made an ass of myself bc idk i just turned off my brain and just started speaking too brash. i think it’s cause i met her at the party and she stole my sunglasses and that just got me used to saying fuck your to her. no kap! don’t really care tho like highkey it’s kinda funny. idk tired ig. been sleeping early that’s been amazing. also the meta is setting one alarm. bc waking up from more than one alarm gets you used to it. and that way of waking up fucking sucks you are way more tired and it’s way harder. trust. i swear the more i’m in uni the older i get i’m gonna be a fucking 30 year old with my dumbass routine and my waking up habits and idk bro. shit is kinda cringe that i’m

losing it ig. had the most embarrassing experience in the gym, genuinely v embarrassed don’t even want to talk about it. wasn’t even my fault. just getting so fucking unlucky these days shit is so cringe. idk i can’t deal with how lonely i am. it’s so bad. watching bojack horseman again, read some analysis and felt inspired to rewatxh it. also just want to consume all the media i consumed while i was extremely depressed. feel like i’ll have a better understanding about it now. but my god i forget how much of a piece of shit he is. maybe it’s cause i kinda related to him too hard but he is really insufferable sometimes. idk. also cried about just cause i feel lonely. we stay sigma tho 💯💯💯💯. i am so fucking lonely nobody actually knows who i am i don’t think i’ve felt unconditional love from anybody in my life and everyday i try to unconditionally love myself to no avail. all i know is conditional love and that has caused serious emotional damage. i just want to be loved so damm bad i can’t go on living like this anymore. anyways! that was really postironic for me to say, actually that was just ironic ! i’m just a jokester and this spam account is just a joke account. i also enjoy cute animals enjoy this dog. he is cute :3. also i keep on :3 but it’s cause i can never express the :3 and silly and girly side of me irl bc i don’t ever feel comfortable and idek how i can even start to be like that and idek if i can ever express myself and i just feel like i’m so much of everything but fail to express who i truly am to everyone so i feel so stuck in this loop of

cat i would not let it go outside bc i would be way too scared for it to die but also i would like make their entire existence revolve around me and not even show the real world.” im sure there’s some layer of irony to it but also this is my idealized girl and then i realized this is actually not my idealized girl and i totally do not want a girl that has mommy issues just cause i have mommy issues. unsurprising i want a mature relationship where i don’t feel like my entire existence revolves around one girl! and i can be autonomous. but ye ig it was kind of eye opening bc it just made me

when i saw the video of my back. idk i love the back bc there’s so many different muscles that are compressed within the back so it looks so textured. there are the traps, teres, lats and rear delts and its all compressed within the chest area so it just makes for a really pleasing look. also you never really see your back so when you do its so fun bc you’re just like damn. was a schizo today at the gym! fun stuff tbh. idk not much to say today, i didn’t even realize how disconnected i was to my friend group but damn. also my sis is texting me and kinda annoying me, kinda don’t want to talk to her tbh just annoyed with her. feel like that happens a lot. honestly just really tired today. also im sorry for posting my physique sm. idk it’s kinda cocky but i’m genuinely v proud of the body i’ve made! literally 550 hours of work which is kinda crazy to think about. also it’s my spam so like fuck you ig! just unfollow bro. but also once i step foot outside of the gym not a single soul sees this so idk i feel as if i need some sort of expression of my body bc i am genuinely so proud of it. this why i need a gf for someone gotta slut this body out :3. idk man can’t stop watching this vid of my back! so happy for myself. but also i am way too fucking lean, my adhd meds kill my appetite so it’s really hard to bulk. but all good atleast i look sexy! idk probs will make more fits that show off my body more, it’s fr my fashion accessory. like rick owens says “working out is the modern day couture” 🤓. anyways idrk what to say today. i am just happy honestly. had a good day today and

to do it so i just walked home. maybe it’s cause j got ghosted and can’t handle rejection but honestly i think the themes of yesterdays rant about how i might be the most alone i’ve ever been manifested into my emotions the next day. cause i felt really alone and sad. i think rn is def the most alone i’ve been but def not the most lonely i’ve felt. i think for the most part i have a lot of self security nowadays so i feel way less lonely. and i think little by little im learning to love myself, unironically i say affirmations before my sets at the gym and it’s been kinda working. idk been talking to myself really empathetic which is change. feels really cringe to say but i think it’s cause i’m so used to just hating on myself all the time. i also cried today which was not really lit. but lowkey, i did a decent amount of hw which i’m actually proud of considering how upset i was today (so upset that i didn’t finish going to the gym which is rare). anyways, played some kirby bc game is braindead and really happy. and idk warmed my heart but also kinda boring. played some dark souls but got too triggered too easily. i think i really want a cat. and lowkey maybe i won’t live on res so i can get one. i think it’ll be really good for me mentally, just to have something to care about. idk, i’ll think about so many bad scenarios in my life (usually social scenarios) and i’ll just be like “well i don’t care” which is nice but also horrible bc idc about anyone. think i just need something to care and love for. also cats are very routine and i’m very routine so i think it’ll be good for me. also it’s a cat and i want to have cat bc he will be cute and i will love him very dearly and hopefully he will cuddle me and we can be besties and i will feed him lots of tuna. tmmrw is a new day and hopefully i will feel better. also might ask this other girl to be fuck buddies but idk &#064;_&#064;. really need some friends! it just can’t be healthy being this socially isolated.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202303/333131729_532695858974390_187543323569993008_n_17998509238606477.jpg"><img

the woman i liked my stories is uninterested in me :o. unlucky ig, but honestly idgaf that much. but like also i don’t think j can have talk to anybody genuinely on social media, just texting her was so hard to do bc i am so weird on instagram. and that’s just like unironic. like we probs have the same music taste but i hate talking about my music taste to girls, idk i just find it so cringe maybe bc im ashamed but also it just feels like 500 days of summer typa shit. unironically i’m just too post ironic to be sincere about my genuine love for my music taste. bc half of it just sounds fucking horrible to like actual people. literally hiding behind irony. but also, texting new people feels so calculsting, like bro do i use :3 &gt;.&lt; and be weird or do i text like a normal person or do i say this random slang like idk. there’s just so much of my weird personality i could show and it feels horrible not showing it and being like calculating instead. idk just feels easier to not calculate and say whatever irl. shit is just so braindead i hate it. also i regret doing it too bc i don’t want to break the image of her in my head. i just want to continue being delusional. but idk i’m just braindead in general. honestly this spam account is really bad for making me idealize girls, once i announce my stupid thought to my story i just spiral deeper into it. unironically tho i’m just so weird. i think that’s what i dislike and love about myself. like it’s amazing bc i feel as if i’ve discovered all these genuine niche facets of my personality that i really love and makes me such a unique but interesting individual. but also i hate it bc how tf am i gonna find someone who’s gonna match all these features. like how am i gonna find someone that wants someone that lives like a 30 year old but says shit like an 18 year old, who is jacked and big but feminine and submissive, who portrays himself as confident and cool but is introverted and a huge nerd etc. i could go on forever about what makes me so unique and it’s genuinely amazing and makes me really confident, but also depressing bc i</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

embarrassing. and not at all represents me. like idk, there’s such a stark dichotomy between drunk me and sober me. it’s honestly kinda sad. but i was really fucked and it was fun, but i just hate how i act when im drunk. so today i just chill bc i was kinda hungover, watched idubbz and sam hyde documentary about each other which was literally 3 hours. idk, it’s pre insane how the same footage can be twisted into such different narratives. and also i kinda hate post irony. like i love cause it’s funny but idk when it’s taken to the extreme it’s just cringe tbh. was gonna have this whole rant about post irony, honestly i should make a new uni discipline that’s just about post irony. shit is so insane and i feel like the most prevalent thing rn. but that’s cause i’m chronically online and everyone is post ironic. also been playing a lot of dark souls 2 . apparently it’s the worst game of the soulslike but it’s still lots of fun. just be like the first level, i honestly suck at the game like idk i’m just really bad with a controller and never really played a soulslike. but i’m having a lot of fun and i just beat this boss and it like took me 3-4 hours. and it’s crazy cause i didn’t even realize it took so long until i did it. idk not much to say! i need a gf that’s about it. would be really cool. :3</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

too, they all kind of have my humour or smth. hopefully i’m not too obnoxious but i think that’s just me overthinking. but also, i played with arthur gf and lowkey she is just like him. like i don’t even notice but i genuinely talk to her like i talk to arthur. lowkey it’s getting too much tho, i have to stop myself from harassing her or being weird bc i almost say something sus to her like i would to arthur. like one time me and her got all the kills and i had to stop myself mid sentence from saying “couples ace!!!!” bc it would’ve been too awk 😭😭. shit was so braindead i’m ngl and honestly more awk that i didn’t say it. but genuinely, i think i’m very happy for arthur, idk i think just playing with the both of them makes me happy he found someone he likes. just thinking about it after makes me happy for him (first recorded instance of carsyn not praying on a relationships downfall). idk i’m actually genuinely happy for them which is such a rare occurrence for me tbh. maybe some of it is bc idk their relationship that well, but i’m not trolling every single relationship i see i always have doubts or judgement in the back of my mind. so seeing myself react this way is kinda strange tbh. me when i learn how to be a good person. idk maybe their relationship really is that good tho who knows &#064;_&#064;. honestly, im busy and should he doing work, i have to write this phil paper and thinking about it got me so stressed. i get too into my head a lot about papers and i actually need others to bounce ideas off of. but ye, overall i do 0 hw and i’ve been doing less bc i get good grades. also i’ve been thinking about asking this girl to be fuck buddies but i don’t want to just text her out of the blue want to hookup. shit would be awk bc i don’t text her and idk it’s just awk. would rather it be more in the moment but idk! maybe i should not be a bitch. but i feel pre comfortable around her so i think that’s why i’m kinda willing to ask her. also im sexually frustrates hehe :3.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202303/334239389_3085422198430375_3226954051343349251_n_17882477312762577.jpg"><img

game is so tiring. and also i was just lagging out at the end which was not fun. also there was this guy that joined who was hella annoying, idk we weren’t playing ranked and this guy was hella igling and tryharding which is kinda cringe bc we’re playing unrated and i’m literally gold. like bruh i play this game to lowkey just turn off my brain and aim. also it’s just really boring when the entire call is just him yapping about some strat that we’re going to poorly execute instead of rando banter. but i could tell arthur was pre triggered and lowkey idk how others couldn’t. idk i think what’s most surprising about people like this is their inability to be aware of their impact. idk, it just seems so obv that they’re killing the vibe of the call but idk! but then again i’m like too hyper aware bc lowkey i thought arthur was triggered at me for being too shit at the game until he msg me and started bitching about the other guy. but also im pre sure my neuroticism is just hella high so whatever vibe or emotion that’s happening i usually feel more than others. which is shit when im having a breakdown but i’ve come to appreciate it bc i feel like it’s allowed to be more empathetic and have better capabilities at pointing out problematic behaviours in others. now that i think about it i spent the entire day sucking arthur’s dick. cause lowkey before i started playing val i was just watching his stream. idk mainly had an unproductive day bc i didn’t take my meds today, so i just wanted to be a degen and do nothing. gym didn’t feel good too cause i was tired. so i just spent a lot of my day in arthur’s twitch chat, and honestly shit is better than soju bc i actually interact with streamer and other chatters. also, the girl im “flirting” with by liking her stories is kinda just braindead bc i swear our entire relationship is literally based around liking each other stories on instagram. but her shit is so funny, lowkey i could tell she broke up with her bf bc her stories are lowkey so unhinged, like the vape matching her drink is just so fucking funny to me that i can’t. idk,</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">productive day even tho i did 0 hw. ig it’s more productive than my other days on resding break. went to gym and was like gonna cry breaking down or some shit. idk just felt like super ass cause felt super lonely and without friends. and i felt like dying but idk those gym sessions are lowkey the best bc i feel like dying the entire time but i train really hard and by the end i still feel like dying but i feel better and less bad. honestly these days are the reason why i train. anyways, lowkey i get too horny st the gym shit is not lit. like fuck being horny st gym no cap. anyways got home and still was feeling like shit but after i took a shower i was like fuck it i need to work on my skirt so i did. finished cutting it out and i’m gonna start sewing it tmmrw bc i need to hang it for a day. and then was still pre sad and i saw that nier automata for the switch was on sale and i was like fuck it so i bought it. and i played it all night. and it’s pre fun game, the combat is kinda mid but i kinda find the characters in the game charming and the robots are cute. a lot of the game is about humanizing the characters and it’s really fun choosing the empathetic route instead of killing mad mfs. idk literally played the game all night, it’s honestly really fun and apparently thematically the game is insane. like this critic account i trust said it was the best video game and i kinda trust that guy so i’m bouta see some insane themes. idk really wish the combat was better but lowkey it got me craving some dark souls, maybe i play dark souls 2 after i beat this game bc i feel like i need to be challenged like that in a game idk. really need to start doing hw but honestly was upset today and had a lot of fun sewing and playing video games. so it was productive happiness which i’m not upset about it bc a lot of days are just meandering on my phone and letting time go by</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

i didn’t realize how tilting it was. but idk was pre good other than that. umm, honestly feeling really horrible today. tbh, there’s a lot of people ik joining golds and honestly i really hate it. i kinda hate interacting with people at golds but also i kinda really hate how everyone sees me at golds. like the gym is kinda my place to be unhinged and insane and slap myself in the face but now that people are going to golds i kinda feel insecure about how i’m acting more. like i be groaning my ass off but now there’s random mfs at golds that i kinda know. this new member is this girl i kinda had a crush on which also makes it kinda bad too. idk man, shit lowkey pisses me off. but honestly it fucking clicked again, i actually have no friends and i’m actually a loner and a loser. it’s kinda fucked up but idk im just really picky with my friends and i just haven’t met anyone i clicked with. idk i guess the loneliness kinda hits me in waves and tn it’s kinda hitting me. idk it’s kinda to the point where i feel like the people i talk to i just can’t relate to at all. shit is just fucked idk. like i guess i just want a gf or smth but also i just want friends i like. lowkey when howard was over after we kinda just did our own thing in my room, i was playing on my switch and he was watching monster. pre sure we both were just tired asf and needed to kill some time but idk i kinda liked that time we spent together bc i think i kinda fuck with just doing things around people i like even if i’m socially drained. but maybe it’s just bc it’s a nice contrast to doing things alone all the time. i’m not even trolling i spend more time talking to myself than talking to others. idk ig i just imagine spending time with a girl chilling not talking and i think that would be fun tbh. but idk, i spend sm time alone it’s kinda rough. also i want a relationship bc im kinda sexually frustrated but i don’t want to have hookups. but ye. i’m pre sick of this tbh, like i still like my life bc i do a lot of fun things by myself but socially my life sucks</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">one year anniversary. only the first picture is a true day one pic all the other pics are from other around 1 month in cause i didn’t start doing poses till then. gained 30lbs of muscle. shits crazy. the difference is literally so insane idk man. as much as i want to be petite and smol bro i am so proud of my body. like my transformation is so insane and i just look cooler and honestly more confident too. i’ve been also kinda anxious about dying recently, which sucks but is also a crazy concept to me bc before i literally did not give af about dying. and i almost did die. just to be scared about my own mortality shows that i actually care about my life and do things i actually like. which is such an insane and crazy aspect and shows sm progress. think that’s what lifting is tho. it’s just a way for me to truly live in the moment and only think about the one thing i’m doing. everything else that makes me anxious disappears in the gym and all i think about is the pain. and the pain genuinely makes me feel so fucking good. like, the pain has shaped who i am and allowed me to appreciate. idk i literally love pain. it’s so hard to describe but i’m so grateful for the pain that’s been invoked into my life, i think i’m just grateful for everything about me and the pain has been able to define sm of me. idk man, im being really gymbro and cringe rn bc im just talking about how “the gym changed my life bro you don’t get it” but genuinely i feels as tho i’ve learned more of the philosophy of my life and myself from going to the gym than like idk wutzke class. feel like i’m learning to love myself from the gym unironically. almost cried thinking about the progress i’ve made mostly mentally. and honestly, i don’t want to discredit you guys, some of you have been there in my darkest moments. but most of the progress is just me and my own will to keep on fighting. and that’s the craziest part. today and the day of my attempted suicide feel way more important than my bday. today feels like a celebration while oct 28 feels like a day to remember. ig they’re both celebrations but idk, feel like these days are such pivotal moments in my life. also i’m jacked and sexy now and if</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202302/332808531_614700133825420_1053788340053803990_n_17952885149315033.jpg"><img

fun tbh. idk, lowkey really like my cogs group, but unironically i think i’m a good group leader. not tryna flex or anything. lowkey trying hard asf in the group, but generally just setting up things and messaging first. and like i don’t want to say i’m the leader but i am but idk feels as tho i am doing a good job at having everyone voice heard and shit. dunno, i honestly like working at groups most of the time, i think it’s pre fun to work with ppl you would never really work with. also lowkey school groups are kinda fun too bc you have something you all do together and sacrifice over and it can be pre rewarding. idrk how we did in the midterm tho, it was kinda hard and idk i just have to kinda trust my group mates did well. but idk pre happy with it. speaking of groups, this rudy guy started talking mad shit about alex cause he was in a group with him. and i want to make this clear, I HAVE NO PART IN INSTIGSTING THIS. so ye. but generally also think he’s cringe and apparently he’s really cringe in a group bc he just doesn’t listen to anyone else and then does his own thing cause he’s condescending and think he is smart. he dumb asf tho sry not sry. also he wears chrome farts (hearts)!!!!!! heheh chrome fart haha fart word funny. but kinda hyped asf to just start gaming for 10 days straight. no cappers. but also need some social interaction but i think i’ll get a lot of it with seeing my sister and having howard sleep over. also lowkey i be wearing oversized clothing cause it kinda makes me feel like a girl. idk, making me feel petite and small no kap. also this heather woman always compliments me by saying i look fem and lowkey idk how i feel about it but i kinda like it. ye. also my hair is growing out and i really like it.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a

hype idk, synergy go crazy. the call made me kinda hyped that howard is coming to van for a day, can’t lie i didn’t really care that much bc i kinda forgot about how easy it is to talk to him and how close we are but calling him yesterday got me hyped up. anyways, the gains are highkey getting into my head, dude i swear i’m like kinda egotistical nowadays or smth. like bro i’m just so jacked it’s making me go crazy. but also my legs are actually huge, makes me look petite. like bro it’s sooo illegal that i can be this jacked and be getting 0 sex. like on utilitarianism my body could provide sm more happiness on a society standard cause i’m so attractive. okay sorry i was just talking about how the gains are getting into my head and then immediately started flexing. idk i’m so braindead! overall, this account has been heavily repurposed. before it just used fo be a daily rant account about how much i want to kms. i looked at my feb 14 2021 post and bro shit was so insane. it would have 10 likes and it’s just me being like bro i want to die so bad idk man life fucking sucks. but nowadays i don’t really share how i’m feeling on this account anymore. but instead of sharing my out of pocket emotions i just talk about out of pocket thoughts like mommy issues or how confident i am. pre crazy. idk i do still like posting on my account and honestly i just want this account to be something that you guys can read and just smile and laugh it. like i think i get sm fulfillment when i make a funny story. i really kike how i’ve tried to just make an entertainment account idk. it’s kinda fun. and it’s pre shocking how many ppl still read these dimbass posts. anyways, last midterm tmmrw i’m so hyped to not do anything for like a week. lowkey gotta grind school a bit but so ready to just relax and game all day. anyways need to be dommed so bad frfr. but idk me getting a gf seems like a v foreign idea to me, idk just finding someone i click with on that seems hard. probs gonna

_a6-i">today is february 14th, and i can already feel the eye rolls coming on. it&#039;s valentine&#039;s day, a day that&#039;s supposed to be all about love, but to me, it&#039;s just a commercialized, over-hyped holiday that makes people feel pressured to express their love in a certain way. maybe it&#039;s because i&#039;m single and not interested in dating right now, or maybe it&#039;s because i hate the idea that love is something that can only be expressed through material gifts or fancy dinners. either way, i&#039;m just not a fan. on the other hand, i&#039;m feeling pretty good about myself lately. i&#039;ve been hitting the gym hard, and my gains are really starting to show. i&#039;ve also been diving deep into my studies, and my intelligence has been paying off in my grades. sometimes i feel like my intelligence and my physical fitness are at odds with each other, but i know they both have their place in my life. it&#039;s all about finding a balance, and i&#039;m determined to do that. anyway, i&#039;m going to spend the rest of the day focusing on myself and maybe catching up on some reading. who needs valentine&#039;s day when you can have a good book and a killer workout.

have a rant over it, but honestly taking it pre well ig. i’m bouta learn infinite and do well the rest of the sem. hopefully. but actually cried a bit over it in therapy. real 💯. gonna grind these days cause i have unit test and midterm. and after that. we fucking gaming. been playing a lot of earthbound. started playing super mario galaxy. and a lot of val. but idk i play it and it’s fun sometimes. but honestly a lot of times it’s just addicting. i feel competitive games put you under a lot of stress and anger when you lose but when you win it’s not like over happy joy. i just am addicted and feel like playing more. also when im addicted to val i just want to spend all my day playing val. kinda unhealthy. so maybe quit or play casually with friends occasionally. fuck valentines. and fuck you if you have a valentines. feb 21 gym anniversary. feb 9 flora bday. all better holidays. valentine’s day is a day to stay sigma and girlboss. feb 21 represents not only gym anniversary but one year of self-improvement. have gone very far in all aspects in life. compared to these feb 14 relationtoids (new derogatory slang word for ppl in relationships) who stay in

to my friends for like 3 days. oopsies. idk, lowkey ever since the alex rant i’ve just gone mia maybe it’s related maybe it’s not. and now instead of irl friends i talk to npcs. but lowkey i really care about my npcs. like my favs prob sprocket all bro talks about is working out but he’s a fucking robot. and i never see him working out. like bruh. but i luv him he’s so cute :3. mfw i go beyond parasocial relationships and just talk to npcs all day. anyways! i met my group mates for my cognitive systems class, and honestly they seem like great ppl! we all really click together and im honestly really excited to work with them and in general i think we will do well so i’m just glad that 45% isn’t an automatic 8th. but honestly, as much as i say i’m socially awk, when i’m like forced into social situations (like in a group setting or in a work place) i think i’m really good at being social. like genuinely, i think i’m good at being social&#064;until&#064;im around my friends or going up to girls. but honestly, im probs not even socially awk, it’s all in my head. idk genuinely, felt like this v extroverted outgoing guy. i think maybe it’s cause there all discord mfs who are losers. and i don’t mean that in a bad way. even tho i couldn’t have phrased that worse. i just think those people kinda hit my niche more (and i’ve been friends with those typa ppl) so it’s just easier to be more socially active. i think i also really suck at nanking convo, once i have a convo i feel like it becomes easy. but starting a convo is really hard. ye. that’s all. midterm thursday

_a6-i">335 for 7 i think. idk, just had psych midterm. atleast got a 80 pre sure, which is okay not the best grace. hopefully a 90. but holy FUCK do i hate psych. it’s like biology but more boring. bc it’s pure content and memorization. and it’s soooooo fucking boring. bc atleast with biology it’s not commonsensical. like i’ve never thought about how cell walls work before. but with psych, i’ve like derived half the theories while i was breaking down crying. like omg!!!! you’re telling me that there’s two types of intelligence. holy i never would’ve thought about that. omgggg an intrinsic motivation is something that you do for yourself, holy fuck. so the whole class is semantics for knowledge you alr know. it’s so fucking stupid. and it’s sm studying. this psych class is the ultimate major for the tryhsrds who avg 50 hours of braindead studying a week but are dumb as hell. like shit is just so stupid all the information is so boring. i fucking hate psych so much. like genuinely i hated studying for it, after i finish i was like this test fucking sucked. cause i don’t think i did bad but bc like just the way it handles content is so braindead. there’s like the most fucking braindead question and there’s like questions where all the terms are in the textbook if you carefully reviewed the textbook on content you learned in class. like it’s just so cringe. atleast with being a bio major you’re probs smart. there’s no way in hell any psych major has more 20 iq in their brain. 0 analysis or intelligence used, im just a robot regurgitating information. mfs be scared chatgpt is gonna replace they jobs like no shit it will if the major is me completely memorizing some bullshit and using 0 complex thinking. anyways, realized i need to be an ipad kid when i eat or i get lost in my thoughts and get sad. it’s pre bad. haven’t really been posting recently, honestly have things to rant about but i be sleeping at 11;30</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

_a6-i">some of my spam story best hits. uhh idk what to say today. probs just boring shit. went to gym today, def need to take a rest day tmmrw bc genuinely was so tired. like was actually so sleepy the entire time. also think i overtrained my arms, my left arm feels kinda injured and that might not be good. might be like a micro tear. i think i might be this girls cafeteria crush or smth. idk i like pass by her and she always kinda looks at me in a flustered way. it’s happened like a couple times this past week. she’s kinda cute (and white and pale i think i have a thing for pale girls and idk how i feel about this) but also maybe im just seeing things. tbh either way i don’t think i’ll develop a crush on her bc unironically, this idea is stuck in my mind that the only compatible partner i will find is someone older than me. i mean it’s not really true but im just kind of too lazy to play my cards with ppl my age. and also, i don’t want to get a random crush on a girl again. but lowkey, at the gym i kinda realized it’s kinda attractive when a girl has like wider shoulders than me. and lowkey now i’m developing gym crushes bc in my head they are older so i’ll allow myself. fuck that i’m focusing on getting gains. but ye, this petite and small thing might not be ironic :3. also i feel kinda closer with gianluca. i’ve kinda realized, bro group convos are not the move and i love one on one. he kinda yaps a lot but it’s kinda nice hearing him talk. we also had a crush on the same girl, he didn’t mention her by name but i could tell who it was. but idk, he’s kinda like me, i see my nerdy aspects in him but he’s not like a true nerd. he likes nerdy shit but isn’t nerdy per say. but he’s also not that nerdy. but that’s kinda like me in a way. and we live pre similar lives, he really wants a relationship and tbh, i think he’s kinda forcing things. bros been thru so many talking stages. but yeah genuinely like talking to him. idk genuinely, this idea of being a sugar baby is stuck in my head. like honestly, it sounds so attractive dating a girl and she pays for my shit. my literal dream. so i’m going myself reserved for a milf who finna pay for my tuition. honestly, this money</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202302/328272269_1030012767832813_7329693861286320327_n_17994199282727608.jpg"><img

_a6-i">okay channeling all my hater energy for this post. this about the guy strutting around at the gym even tho he was a noob, and the tiktok is providing a visual example how he struts (and his personality too tbh). also, before i write this post, i want to apologize to z*****r (censoring cause i don’t want him to read this post at all and he might if sees his name) cause at the end of the day he has to with know how much i hate this guy while being friends with both of us. honestly i kinda pref he just didn’t read this post. okay, i genuinely can’t stand this guy named alex. and he’s literally the only other asian i’m “friends” with. just everything about him makes me fucking cringe with disgust. i’ll start off the reasons why i hate him and then i’ll dissect his personality. he has no respect for my personal space. like i kinda get how straight guys act gay around the homies cause it’s funny but he overdoes it sm and it’s clear from how little i play along that i’m uncomfortable. moreover, he just gets right up&#064;in your face for fun or&#064;smth idk. like he does it too be funny but it’s so not funny and it’s honestly really annoying and it genuinely makes me want to punch him. like we not tight like that you can’t just go in my personal space. this personal space thing is honestly a really big deal. next is obv the gym strutting thing. fuck that strutting is cringe esp if you have no qualifications to the culture. and this strutting thing is like an analogy to his personality and why i hate him sm. it’s hard for me to pinpoint and provide exact examples to why i hate him sm, but i think it’s his demeanour and what that reveals about him that makes me so genuinely annoyed. i don’t want to sound pretentious here, bc it’s abs fine to like basic things. but what pisses me off is when you think you’re the shit while like basic things (bc it shows you have no knowledge). for example, alex told me about this idea about making a white leather vest that looked like a ribcage. and i was trying my hardest to not get involved bc the idea was not original. maybe the white leather vest but this rib cage idea was like a 20-21 trend. so it’s so overplayed. but he just had so much…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202302/FQIoAkMzLBdAMwpdsi0RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17953414754426323" controls="1"

love with pushing myself insanely hard bc it makes me feel insanely good about myself. had a french test today too which was not as pog. don’t think i did that well. all goodge ig. not really. also had my therapy appointment, was pre insane actually talked about a lot things. unironically my therapist is probs the root of me being like i have mommy issues, not in a weird way it’s just that she’s always like “you’ve developed a lot of skills prematurely and you only really see that in mfs in their 30s. i can def see you’re crowd being older.” and idk hearing that is not pog bc how am i gonna talk to anyone that’s not 18. sounds way too hard. but idk talked to her about dating older and if i were getting groomed or smth idk. it just sounds not hype bc honestly i think i will date someone older than me in the future just bc i’ve been able to (sorry for ego) mature prematurely. unlucky ig idk. also it’s just gonna be kinda weird and taboo.  but also pog asf bc im tryna find these older woman sooner so they can start paying for my tuition no kap. and then pay for all my dates. man i’m fucking fown. where these older woman at im a poor college student who’s diced and smart and apparently emotionally mature. i’m in desperate need of an older woman who is rich. no kap! and i have mommy issues! please buy me rick owens! but ye, idk i really wish this wasn’t the case (and it might not be it probably will be) but ig it is what it is. also i did hw today and im so slow at writing. it’s horrible. overall, feeling pre good about everything ig. talked about how saying this love word quite literally makes me cringe. but ye. sleepy and tired. i’m such an eeper. man i want to be a cat so bad. i would eep all day. and then eat fish. i would eat sm tuna everyday. and then eep. i would eat a lot of food, but workout. so i could eat more food. and then be tired and eep. man why can’t i be a cat. this gotta be like my biggest cat phase. quite literally becoming a cat boy

also how cropped it. really good proportions 🤓. but ong finally found a hoodie i really like. second slide legit is a fit of mine, i really liked it but when i look at that photo all i think about is “this is so opium 🤓” “bro think he’s carti 🤓” “this is so destroy lonely” and i want to kms. even with the first photo too. anyways, i have started tailoring another hoodie to look like the hoodie i just bought. honestly it’s not that much work but i’m pre busy these next two days so idk if i can get it done soon. if you couldn’t tell i’m really into fashion rn, just looking at a lot of runway shoes and thinking about clothes more. been also trying on my fits more everyday. but ill&#064;prob get lazy again. honestly idk what to talk about this spam post, ig just generally have not been too sad these past couple of days which is good. need to start grinding hw. also, not tryna ego too hard but how tf do i have crushes. like i’m literally jacked, mysterious, smart, well dressed, emotionally mature, quiet guy and i get random crushes on girls??? okay i’m sucking my dick too hard but like bro. like genuinely, im the type of person nowadays where you think they too cool to like have feelings. fr need a girl to develop feelings for me first before i date. 2023 no&#064;more crushes fuck that. okay but fr tho i lowkey want this to happen bc im lowkey just into girls who would ask me out and be more dominant &gt;.&lt;. i’m down to be the traditional role of a woman in a relationship :3. i might be mysterious but really my mysteriousness comes from me being shy ö. really i’m a chronically online wannabe girl Ü. okay i’m down with the emotes. we changing my texting meta now, i will start reacting with pictures of cats. i really love cats im back in a cat phase. i loveeeeeee cats sm they have my whole heart their so cute and independent and dumb and i love them smmmm &lt;3. i’m literally a cat. like why was not i born a cat. instead of doing all these human things i could be eepy all day and push things off desk. shit would be hella lit. and if i get bored i would go hunt mice or fuck bitches. man shit</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a

_a6-i">spent $200 on this margiela cardigan. bruh idk if it’s worth it but it’s kinda dope ngl. uhh, idk not much to say today. literally didn’t do anything other than workout. actually, there’s this girl (the one that looks like maria) that i see all the time and it’s getting to the point where i feel like a creep. like i atleast see this girl 2x a day and lowkey that’s why i liked her cause my brain sees patterns and then is like hehe what if fate is making me see her. but like i can detest seeing her cause i’m just like “she def think i’m stalking her” cause i be seeing her all the time. also, the interactions with the girls looking at me at the gym lowkey made me realize, wait my body is actually attractive to like girls. like idk, maybe it’s cause i get no attention from girls but it kinda made me realize like bro, i have like an attractive body. yk how guys kinda stare at girls ass. ye, i got like a fat ass but in terms of a guy. idk, shit never really clicked for me i can’t lie. like i think mainly the sexual attraction part. in my brain i’m just like hehe i look so aesthetic and lean. but no girls actually get like horny and shit??? idk not saying those girls did but idk i’m just such an incel that i don’t make the connection that i’m sexually attractive. that is so weird. which brings me back to the point where there was this girl with her (i assume) guy bsf at the frats and i’m wearing this wife beater. and this guy bsf telling me she wants me and she’s like bro no he wants you. and i’m drunk asf so i think i’m getting made fun of bc no woman has ever hit on me and it kinda sounds like they trolling me. anyways, didn’t bag her, maybe that was negative rizz. bc highkey, it don’t click that big muscles are attractive. imo being petite and smol is more attractive &gt;.&lt;. anyways, i be sleepy now. don’t mean to be flexing i’m getting hit on but idek if i’m getting hit on. this just seems so weird and improbable to me. maybe “i’m sexy” and “i don’t know it” LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202301/327149878_864436794784709_8061170521230498514_n_17961470297330040.jpg"><img

all my energy. went to ballet lessons yesterday and i’m signed up for the semester, honestly really proud of myself for doing that. i’m really bad at trying new things and pushing myself out my comfort zone, so i’m actually really proud for doing it. honestly, it was kinda stale at times and i was one of three guys there, but idk still was lots of fun. and also seeing myself jacked and doing ballet was kinda pog. next week i’m going to try to actually talk to people. i lowkey have a crush on a girl but i know it’s not a real crush it’s just me projecting everything i want on to her. even knowing that i can’t stop imaging fake scenarios, pre sure i just get crushes so i can imagine cute fake scenarios in my head with someone. pre cringe but hopefully i get over it. or i start to get to know her better and date her. but that probs won’t happen. also got infinite work done today, this is one of the first days i actually did hw. lowkey kinda stressed bc midterms are coming up. but it’s all good. anyways, i’ve come to accept im extremely desperate for a gf. but it’s all good cause i can sit and wait. that’s all v tired rn.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">happy chinese new year. i be playing on my switch and shit. had a sleepover with my sister yesterday and it was really fun. honestly really grateful for the relationship with my sister and i can’t lie, im getting more used to saying i love you to her. i think before i was just really not used to the idea of love ever since i’ve been depressed, but now i feel like it’s less forced when i say it to her. which is nice. good progress ig. idk, we just gamed at her house and ate food. idk it was honestly really fun. and we played a bunch of switch sports which was also very fun. anyways, called my parents and they were like “you should go out for chinese new year.” but uighkey i just want to be in my loser shit and not go out. ye. but tmmrw i’m kinda nervous cause i signed up for ballet lessons. honestly, putting myself really out of my comfort zone here. and i’m genuinely really nervous, idk if it will be for me but i decided that since i wanted to do it so bad and the fact that i need to actually be pushing myself out my comfort zone, im going to do it. but i’m lowkey a loser bc i feel like ppl do these type of things with their friends but i have no friends. speaking of, i’ve literally gone no contact for my friends for like 3-4 days which i feel kinda bad. they also don’t contact me but it’s kinda made me realize that they’re used to it. which is good ig. but idk feel like i should go talk to them or smth. but genuinely, my like two years of depression has made me so used to not talking to anyone. like i think i became way more introverted from being depressed and now i spend so much of my time being alone. anyways, i haven’t done any school work and it’s giving me a lot of anxiety nor doing anything. i need to catch up too. but i will be fine it’s just making me so anxious bc idk, it feels like i need to do more school work as a student. and when i’m not i just feel like i’m not doing enough. but i need to relax and just be happy i’m chilling. anyways, im spending chinese new year alone but hopefully you all had a fun new year :3. it’s not too bad tho i be gaming.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

together cuddling on my bed. wouldn’t that be pog crazy. anyways, lowkey got a crush on a girl, but like in a way where i don’t know her at all and i just idealizing her in my head. not crazy over her or anything but she keeps on popping in my head and i recognize that lowkey just have a crush on her. every spam post is becoming the same old. cause the next thing i want to say is, lowkey was thinking about being a girl today. be looking at my face and being like huh wonder what i could do. idk man. was thinking about shaving my legs are smth but idk. but ye. also want a gf so lowkey i can

play the game a couple of times but i didn’t want to talk to my villagers and them asking me why i was gone for so long cause it would make me feel v guilty. also just sick rn so i legit gamed on my switch all night and i gotta say, i love playing on my switch. when the games start hitting they start hitting. also met some new people today, it’s always surprising when i meet new people. like i feeel like i’m too socially awkward and don’t really seek it out. but idk, maybe they are my people i’m not too sure but it was nice talking to them. i got invited to thrift but didn’t go bc my head hurt too much cause i’m sick. but also highkey i just stutter my words a lot, i feel like i’m becoming more socially inept every month for no reason. but idk, it was kinda nice talking to them just cause we just had random small talk. ye. also two of them were kinda cute so ye. but i was in no state to talk, looked sick and probs disgusting. anyways, not going to go to class tmmrw either, lowkey

don’t feel a need to go on my phone as much. and i didn’t feel any need to pick up my phone and scroll when i woke up. also spent less time in my bed throughout the day. and was less tired today, tho idk if that has any correlation. tiktok addiction actually 10x improving quality of life. saw my therapist today. and like subconsciously i’ve been acting like a girl way more. and i’m still kinda resistant to it. but idk more and more i start to act like a girl. dude having these big muscles actually a problem now. when i want to be a girl. also might be sick idk. but idk sometimes i’ll start walking like a girl or something, it’s hard to describe but i lowkey do it. mfw my only dating pool rn is bi girls bc idk if i’m a girl or a guy. and like lowkey, i was a looking at my reflection

online argument :P. anyways went fratting yesterday, honestly mid asf, it was raining so i was cold asf and the music was ass and i had a doraemon on my keychain and i lost it and i was so sad about it. also i saw tamara again and idk shit just fucking blows. and like every time i talk to her she like makes fun of me? idk really know how to describe it but i’ll ask her to repeat herself and then she’ll just make a bunch of weird gestures. idk, annoying asf. but also i think she tried to kiss me on the cheek but i pulled away. honestly i’m not too sure bc i was really drunk maybe my recounts of events is incorrect but either way that idea makes me feel really disgusted. also she’s ugly. okay kinda mean but she just presents herself in a really masculine way and honestly not attracted to it all. lowkey i want a girls who fem asf and me to lowkey be like that too. can’t lie. but also tamara just kinda ugly sorry not sorry. it’s crazy that i was so interested in that girl tbh, feel like honestly i was kinda deluding myself during then which is kinda embarrassing. idk i just hate seeing her and i wish she just didn’t exist or smth. but honestly, what made last night worth it was my walk home with josh, idk we were just talking about some real shit and it was a really good drunk talk. honestly more and more i’ve just come to realize i can’t really do friend groups. i feel like sometimes it works but at the end of the day i just like individual people in my friend group but not everyone together. which is kinda annoying bc i feel like the only way i get to spend time with people is in a friend group environment. but honestly, feel a lot closer to josh after last night which is nice. and honestly, i hate fratting a lot i think i rather just go to a house party, even my sister one where i was way out of place and really socially awkward was fun bc there was people to talk to. and i just like talking. anyways, basically just laid in bed the entire day. need to start on a new project, actually i have one in mind, i want to tailor a ubc hoodie to make the fit better and cooler. problem</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

everyday, like i swear i’m just so tired and idk why. it’s actually a fucking grief i hate it sm. also, these last 3 days have been abs ass, feel so mentally shit for some reason. i have no clue why. i just can’t with everything or smth. literally just having daily breakdowns for fun. also, started my meds and the worst part is my complete lack of appetite. literally felt like vomiting half the day and it’s ass. and also had a bad leg day. but watched la haine bc i was feeling like ass, and it’s pre good. idk if it’s like amazing but it’s pre good. it’s major catcher in the rye vibes cause you just see 3 youths just dicking around in the city at night. and honestly at the end i was getting kinda bored until the final scene. and then i was like holy fuck this shit is insane. but ye. also saw tamara yesterday and today, i literally don’t want to talk to this woman. i caught a glimpse of her and she literally called my name to talk to me. and idk just was like awkward asf ig. and then today she sat with us which was not pog crazy cause my other friends left and i was just sitting with her and her friends except she was with her gf and i was way too tired to talk to them. and i’m just like why did you choose to sit with me like idk man. feels like she’s just intentionally being an asshole which is annoying but i genuinely also don’t care. like i’m not jealous or upset i’m just like why must you talk to me. and lowkey go out your way to sit with me with your gf. idk weirdge. her gf honestly pre mid tho can’t even lie. also one of her friends is such a nic fiend, she like threw away her vape to quit and she texted my friend to go out his vape and let her hit. also just begging to hit. shits annoying asf, i can’t lie, i don’t mind people vaping but when people beg others and start coping and saying “im going to quit” pisses me off sm. tbh, i hate copers the most. just face the truth and stop being a bitch</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

_a6-i">some clips of me being high asf. got high yesteray nothing really to say. shit got me so extremely tired today, was eepy the entire day and it’s preventing me from doing anything fun. eepy life ig. lowkey, i smiled to this homeless guy and he started talking to me and idk shit was kinda cool ig. feel like i have saviour complex tho idk. but the one thing from english hs i remember so prominently is mr walcott explaining how he used to talk to hella homeless ppl and they all said the worst thing about being homeless was when ppl ignored them and treated them less than human. so idk i always acknowledge them even if it’s to reject them. idk, the convo was kinda nice and it kinda makes me want to do community work. idrk tho, he just seemed like he wanted to talk. never really considered the social isolation of homelessness. he also said my face was really honourable or smth but i think it’s cause i smiled to him. also went to the gym again and it feels so good to be back, ready to push my fucking limits to infinite again. i’m honestly so damn judgemental but like i can’t help it idk. also i’m so horrible at receiving compliments, like 5 ppl complimented me at the gym today and i just said thank you i had no clue what to say to actually show my appreciation. think it’s just cause i get kinda shy when ppl compliment me ngl. also ppl complimenting my fit, didn’t get a chance to show it but i think it was pre dope ig. also need to start a new project for sewing. overall, just tired asf. if i wasn’t so damn eepy i would be king of the world. also feel like i say this a lot, but i realized after compliments, lowkey aren’t i just like pog crazy at life, jacked, can dress (ig), good at school, two years of therapy and interesting. idk man. i’m just saying. unironically don’t think i’ll be cuffed for a long time bc i lowkey know my worth. also, the moment i stepped on campus i started to want to be a girl again. swear ubc (liberal institution) sending estrogen thru waves. jk probs just more comfortable being myself at ubc. but stay pog crazy everyone and hopefully this sem treats you guys well &lt;3.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

i brought a hockey bag and this was house i walked around with it. on top of my tiny ass carry on shit was a grind. walked probs a total of 50 minutes like that. res only opened today and my flight landed yesterday so i stayed over at my sis place. except they were having a party there so i partied with my sis friends. and my god am i socially awkward. like genuinely, if i’m not drinking i suck at meeting new people. idk, think a big part was that they aren’t ppl i usually interact with (ie 5 years older and all queer) so i didn’t really know how to interact. but it was fun tbh. i just suck at being socialable. and they are all really nice. lowkey, some of them are cringe but i feel like i’ve kinda realized that i’m way too self conscious and self aware. it’s actually bad need to let myself go and to be able to do that i actually need to stop judging others for being cringe tbh. but yeah, it was really fun got really drunk and talked to her friends and played on my switch which was cool. just got blasted too. but it’s also crazy that i’m at a house party with all 23 y/o and one of them was actually like 32. i be deadass talking to millennials like deadass i hate myself now no kap. but idk. finally in my dorm and tbh, after going back to calgary and living with my parents i feel like i’ve realized my dorm is my home now. feel way more comfortable here on campus in my

takes) happily (and not losing faith in humanity). fr tho, the more i grow up the more faith i lose. honestly tho, im too cynical, i think of humanity usually devoid of all humanity and empathy leading to vicious destructive cycles when usually they stop. but idk, being online is kinda bad for me bc i just see such bad takes online. tired asf tho rn, i haven’t been able to gym for a week. honestly feels bad that i’m taking time off but then again, is it really that bad. it’s literally a winter break i should be resting. also, hanging out unironically is exhausting me more than school. it’s mainly the lack of schedule that makes going to the gym hard. all g will start when i go back. can’t believe i’m going to be leaving soon, idk if i’m ready for school tbh. but i’ll be able to handle it. what’s not mega pog is that i won’t be seeing my therapist for a month. actually ig that’s a sign of progress bc i don’t need to see her. but idk, feels v scary to see my therapist less bc idk, just scared if things go wrong if i will be able to handle it myself. unironically this trans thing might’ve been a phase, idk tho haven’t really questioned it for a long time. and also stopped caring how i look while in calgary. idk, just makes me feel v conflicted a lot tbh. feels like all my friends are getting partners, ngl my girl friends be carrying this list bc none of my guy friends pull. pre happy for them but also just lowkey jealous cause i want a gf madge. all goodge. but whenever someone tells&#064;me like a downside to being in a relationship in my head i’m just like “okay i prob wouldn’t date someone that did that anyways.” like only valid criticism is like commitment. but some people are like “it’s too much work” and idk i’m just like yeah but if it’s someone i actually like i would be willing to do that much work. but honestly, pre stable without a relationship, like obv i have needs to be met but it’s not the worst being alone. i used to want one real bad and to be touched real bad but honestly, being mentally stable literally just means you’re kinda fine being alone. idk rant is irrelevant asf,m</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

experimenting with shit. got this all cause i went thrifting with lisa, was pre fun and it was nice catching up. but v tiring, idk nothing gets me tired as much as shopping. esp malls, they tire me out. it’s just so much stimulus and products and people and idk. it’s tiring being in a mall. honestly, feel like i should be out partying this new years but i’m just about to go to bed rn. lowkey cause i be a loser who don’t get invited to parties. but honestly, its honestly better this way like i don’t really want to be tbh. that’s not even a cope, like it would be fun to drink but also at the end of the day this is NEAL (not even a loss). like i really need this time to get energy back tbh, gonna hang out like 5 days in a row and it’s gonna be hard cause i be way too introverted. also, it’s crazy how i’m starting to not feel a need to rant on my spam when i’m having breakdowns. atleast not into detail. just a pre insane sign of progress that i don’t use this spam to cope. i think one of the best things i’ve been able to internalize is that everything is temporary. i used to hate that fact bc everything being temporary meant that eventually relationships fade or change and there was nothing constant in my life for meaning. but honestly, it’s kinda based now, i just know that whatever i’m feeling, it’s only temporary. and things being temporary allows for sm opportunity for change and i think change makes people human. like we are always evolving as people and that’s what distinguishes us from other species. crazy how such a perspective change has made such a change in my life. anyways, i don’t believe in new year’s resolutions, pre sure i’m gonna resent them bc the gym is gonna be filled with resolution people. but it’s an evil i have to take because it makes my membership cheaper. anyways, im out of her and happy new years to all &lt;3. wishing all a prosperous year &gt;.&lt;</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

flowing so smoothly, like we just end up talking about the most random shit and it’s kinda pog. lowkey, richard is actually living the sigma life, swear this guy never has an update in his life but he’s always pre pog to talk to. dunno sometimes he talks like a business student but lowkey pre sure richard is v good st making convos. lowkey talked to a lot to arthur today tho cause i drove him and richard was 30 min late, and lowkey just the way he was talking something changed about him. but idk, me and arthur were always like lowkey close which is kinda weird cause it feels like we’re not but we are. but anyways, he said some pre impactful things today, like he was like “yeah after reading your post this last year, i can tell you’ve improved a lot and i’m proud of that.” and that was kinda nice just cause idk it’s nice to hear about someone actively see my progress and not just me yelling in an echo chamber. but he’s also def emotionally matured a lot too, i think it’s mainly about how he always kinda emphasizes it during conversations in comparison to before shows his value for it. it’s also how chill he is? idk it’s kinda hard to pinpoint these things. but idk, we honestly talked about my mental health a lot and just how far i’ve gone and it’s pre crazy that i actually kinda made it. and honestly overall, it’s pre awesome how they’ve changed but are the same. for example, this arthur guy said the world “kleptomaniac” (which is a person who loves to steal) and it kinda made me realized like i haven’t talked to smart ppl using big words. and it kinda shows change cause i’ve never heard arthur say this word. and then richard is like “bro i’m pre sure there’s a league trait called that.” idk kinda braindead moment but i feel like it was just a moment where things were different and the same at the same time. idk, this rant is so jumbled and there’s sm more i want to say (i feel like talking to arthur made me realize how many rants i have) but idk

i hate about him. or he’s just someone i still hate idk. but yeah, tried to sew yesterday but honestly couldn’t really just cause i still feel like shit. guess feeling a bit better today. feel like a handful and too much but tbh when these days happen all i want to do is be left completely alone. idk i just hate interacting with my family. also haven’t been to the gym these last two days which is really odd. tbh. honestly, these type of days make me wonder if i really will be able to have a long term gf, idk feel like i’ll just end up acting like a bitch to her. but also i really want someone

it was fucking fun asf. i didn’t know if it was bc we just played on switch or if it’s because there’s no nick, but like shitbwas pog crazy. idk guess it was fun to catch up. think the group dynamic isn’t as bad as it used to be if certain people aren’t there. and if we actually find something to do. heard updates from people and honestly was a lot of fun. can’t lie, im super busy this break hanging out with people but it’s so good to see everyone again bc i feel like i actually talk about topics that are interesting. like yesterday was just talking to howard and owen about fashion and im like this is honestly enjoyable. like, just looking at clothes being like idk i don’t really like this, or like this is pog crazy. it’s just fun to do. speaking of clothes, i think what i love about learning sm is how intricate things really are. ig that’s what learning really is, like every discovery we make only leads us to have more questions. but i never realized how much of an empty canvas fashion was, there’s sm that goes to making clothes that’s it’s genuinely very insane. and when i was looking at clothes, i began to notice way more details of how things are made, and also just paying more attention to fabrics and it’s just a better way to discern what i like. i also like visvim a lot, like i would look at a piece of clothing, be like this is fire, look at tag, see it’s visvim and then see it costs $2000. gg. but i think my project after these pants are going to be like a cropped or tailored jacket with very long sleeves, going to try and play around lining and interfacing to really shape the jacket to how i want it to be. gonna also just look at infinite jackets to see what i like. but idk, genuinely such a good time to learn. i think that’s the one thing i’ve always loved. i love learning. like genuinely, i love learning sm. and i wish that i could spend my whole life learning. anyways, i can’t finish my pants bc i haven’t gotten my replacement

and it’s just off putting. and then he turned to talk to me and i was really uncomfortable. idk man maybe i just hate my dad or it reminded me of just him yelling at me or smth. but also this woman

more than that tbh. like running a fashion business sounds v hard, idk making creative designs is hard. plus it’s also just way less pay for the amount of effort. unless you’re a braindead print graphic tees from blanks. than it’s too ez. also a fashion job you put in like 10x the effort for the pay. not worth. maybe i might run something lowkey, just sell random clothes i made on ig. idk. but i really do love sewing. and played lots of tft hit plat which is pog. anyways, hope you all had a good christmas, hopefully you had a good time with your fam or atleast had a good christmas

anything i always do bad bc unironically idk the school&#064;meta. but now that i have an idea of the meta in uni, i literally have learned infinite and im bouta go first in my grades. like yeah essay writing and studying got better, but also like how i want to go about doing my work has changed. and just how much work i should be allocating is also changed. also how to learn french. idk just learned fucking infinite. and also learned that sewing is my fav hobbie in the world. my fucking god. this hobby is so fun. like idk i’m having sm fun about everything about it. like going to the fabric store im sitting there for like a hour looking st fabrics with ideas rumbling throughout my head. and at home i’m looking runway shows being like “oh shit that piece is hard i didn’t know if you did this idea like that it could look so well.” and looking at clothes is sm fun. but with these pants i’m literally learning infinite and getting better. like i made a pattern by myself, using a different seam, drawing the :3 on my pockets and altering patterns for my needs. like bro. i’m literally just learning infinite. everyday i’m just learning infinite.btw, school is so ez pre sure i did good on all my finals bc i actually studied instead of trolling. but ye. that’s all. this sem learn infinite. bouta just go first next sem. also next sem bouta be 10x happier too.</div><div

the other slide is this jacket that was really fun that i wanted to cop but decided i wouldn’t. back in calgary. kinda lit. maybe its cause nobody is here but being in this city makes me feel kinda sad. like i feel sm more lonely in this city. idk prob a big part is that nobody is actually here but like just driving around by myself today i was like damn, i got no friends. but went to westside today and it was kinda crazy. idk, im actually one of the bigger guys there now which is pre insane. it’s kinda like revisiting where  i started. but like shit is so quiet, i used to like how quiet it is but now i feel like the fucking biggest menace in the world when i grunt. bro i’m not even tryna grunt it just be happening. but yeah. idk felt really cool cause it’s literally like revisiting where i started. and this old guy i always used to see def noticed my progress cause he complimented me. kinda pog. little does he know under all this muscle, deep inside is a man that wants to say “haiiiii ^_^ :3” and wants to be a girl. anyways, just waiting on my friends to come back, msg me when you do. so we can hang. v excited to do that. for now i wait. also being off the meds feels

bitch about grades. i hate giving af about grades. like bruh i’m so over it. like i only care cause i want to get into cogs, but idk what i want to do. like i feel like cogs is what i want but also at the same time stressing about my grades is so cringe. like i actually can’t stand it. most of my classses i have like around an 82 avg, and to be like guaranteed i prob need like an 85. so basically, i have to obsess over like the slightest percent of grades, which is so unbelievably cringe. like i hate it. like i hate how if i get like 3% below an 85 it’s not a good enough. me when i’m a uni student and i actually have to study and work hard for good grades. okay but fr tho, im actually not used to studying at all, realized this is the first time i’ve studied for multiple finals. like i’ve never done this. and i actually really want to clutch up. like tryna make my finals a grade boosters. which puts sm pressure bc i have to care sm and put in more effort to get the couple of percents i’ll be happy with. which is just so cringe. like wtf. so over that bs. and all 3 of my finals are within 3 days, and my final essay too. just so fucking cringe. and idk, im just so sick of actually caring about my grades. (me as a student when grades actually matter and it’s not something i just dgaf about). idk i think i just hate having to be obsess over them. like idk, lowkey down to just do whatever dog shit major and just call it. cause i don’t want to be doing this. like idk going into a competitive major is not fun and idek if i will like it. and also, since i have to study sm, doing anything makes me so guilty. like i feel so guilty going to the gym bc i could be studying. or i’m like “i gotta cut down on my eating time to study more.” like bruh. diesofcringe. idk. that’s really about it. honestly, more than anything, i just want to do something i’m happy with and learn things that i actually enjoy. like honestly i really want a simple life. if we don’t count this exam thing,</div><div

euphoric day at the gym, added this new leg and holy fuck was it fucking lit. literally was shaking and i’m going to be chasing the high i got for like years. but made me really tired so studying today is honestly v hard. might just call it quits studying today. honestly not studying that much. but still i feel like i need to study infinite. have exam in two days and two exams on one day in four. so i actually have to grind. but so excited to go home and chill. anyways. didn’t get gf first sem. unlucky guess i’ll just die idk. fr tho, life sometimes feels so ass cause i don’t feel comfortable ever expressing my softer side. like tbh i’m kinda of a bitch, and it makes me feel ass that i never really get to express but it also makes me really hurts my confidence cause i don’t want to be such a bitch. honestly, don’t have much to say other than i’ve been grinding studying. and been really responsible, sleeping 11-12 and waking up at 9. can’t believe i’m gonna be home in 5 days. crazy. also def want to hang out with anyone who is also home. except ryan.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">okay random rant today. bro ever since i’ve moved in to uni, i’ve been legit getting nightmares. and it’s not like the ones i’ve had as kids. like today, i woke up at 4:30 and i’m pre sure i was having like a panic attack. cause every time i would try to sleep, i would get so anxious i would never wake up again or smth and then wake up. or something would happen in my dream, like pre sure somehow i ended up at westside and i started panicking or smth and then i ran into and i wake up. also napping while on my adhd meds is way diff. anytime i try to nap i always wake up, but i first wake up while dreaming. so everything feels so surreal and i’m awake but im actually dreaming about waking up. and then i actually wake up. and it’s kinda scary cause everything feels so weird, like my hands aren’t really there. and i’ve gotten sleep paralysis like twice. idk. maybe it’s just cause im in a new place and my body doesn’t feel safe. anyways, skipped two classes today bc i was kinda sad and i forgot to take my adhd meds and i didn’t sleep well and it was last day of classes so i was like fuck it. also unironically this haiiiii shit might not be a meme anymore. it’s pre cringe and cursed but also like bruh unironically i want to feel cute. like bruh. feel like such a cringer when i want to be all cutesy and shif and i feel like that’s only gonna happen in a relationship. born to haiiii :3; forced to wsg brother. also i was wearing my eva hoodie, listening to ecco, had my headphones act like a headband and had my sleeves over my hands and i was like bruh, the signs have always been here. like i look back and i’m like bruh i’m way more feminine than i thought. like deadass, we got like a 50/50 chance i become a femboy. unlucky ig idk. okay but fr tho, i want to talk about things i want to do to kinda change how i look but feel like you guys think i’m cringe idek. fuck it ig. want to wear earrings more often tbh. idk they pre cool and that. i just like how they look. also i need to buy a headband or like get my hair to go back. but idk want to grow my hair out. and get like eren yeager type hair or like a wolf cut. that felt really cringe to say no lie. but also</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202212/GPGvARMY63YQSNMBAAozIKisjOQebkYLAAAF_17975315920783772" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank"

feeling is. like during aftermath and like when i’m happy i’m just like why would i ever want to die. and then during im like bro i should’ve fucking ended it so much earlier. like every time i forget how&#064;awful it feels to feel like ass. like sometimes i wish i was depressed out of my mind again like two years ago where getting out of bed was hard and everyday was literally the hardest day of my life. but i forget how hard those days actually were/ anyways, not a good day to get this criticism either. had to write a big part of&#064;my essay and it really fucked with my confidence. so yeah. idk man. honestly i wouldn’t care that much about my grade but i want to get into a hard program so all of a sudden i have to care. diesofcringe. wish i just didn’t care. idk man. overall, just not in a good mental state for today. i think tmmrw i’ll be over it but it was kinda bad. and honestly, feel like it’s gonna be kinda hard to find a partner or anything cause like i feel like a burden. like i probs shouldn’t say this for the sake of my own mental health but like i just can’t help but feel like i will always feel like a burden and want to kms when the smallest things happen. think that’s just how my mind works. like i’m able to generalize concepts in school really well. and i’m able to generalize experiences in my life really well. which leads to me generalizing a bad experience into my whole life. un fucking lucky. rn would be a really good time for a gf tho no lie.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

be complementing me about it and it actually makes me so happy. esp bc ppl that didn’t know i made it complimented it. so like yeah. was hype as fuck and i’m honestly really happy with it. and honestly, on a purely like clothing basis it’s my fav piece of clothing out of any the clothing in these slides just cause it fits so well and it’s just a nice cardigan. 2nd slide is me looking like a tool. got the balenci shades (that i prob can’t rock idk), two westwood necklaces, only got one of them bc i saw the bat and was like batchest. got the other one cause i was like bro i’m literally nana from nana i gotta get it. two chrome hearts rings, kinda nice. generally was tryna keep it lowkey. slide 3 and 4 are literally blank hoodies. quality is really good but honestly most disappointed about these hoodies cause i wish they were wider. really feel like hoodies is like the most disrespected piece of clothing, it seems every brand fucks up their hoodies and it just doesn’t look good. like hoodies can look so good but idk, it’s so hard to find the right looking hoodie. they gotta be wide, kinda cropped and just look comfy. slide 5 is this like gorpy japanese brand jacket. like haha a bunch of zippers so like techwear! slide 6 is this v oversized korea brand jacket, abs love it. it’s so oversized and dumb it’s so huge i love how huge it is. it’s like fucking gigantic. slide 7 is oversized balenci cargos. honestly really like them but idk if it’s my style really. actually, wearing them makes me feel like avg opium fan and it makes cringe. def could style them well but idk just reminds me of destroy lonely too much and makes me wanna die. slide 8 this eva x undercover hoodie. honestly, thought it was cool but lowkey it’s kinda corny. front is like “don’t run. don’t run. DONT run” idk i love eva tho no kap so i’ll prob rock it. again don’t like hoodie fit. slide 9 is rick owens x doc shoes. honestly look pre cool. also just a nice pair of docs tbh. but haha lacing look cool. and slide 10 is us hanging out in an empty lecture hall. generally, i’ve never owned such high quality clothing</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

my finished cardigan. the buttons legit took way too long like making buttonholes is actually v hard and it took me forever. overall happy, some places look very unprofessional but overall not bad for a first project. second slide is my fit and i like it’s very comfortable and makes me feel confident and green + brown combo = omg what a pog colour combination that’s never been done!!! okay anyways. buddy is hella confused rn. like idk it was  a normal day at the gym and then i thought about wanting to be a girl and that’s when i realized: this shit ain’t a joke no more. last week i talked about wanting to be more feminine to my therapist and it actually made it real. like i only talked about being a girl jokingly and on this account but when i talked to my therapist about it it wasn’t a joke anymore. like bruh. shit actually tilted the fuck out of me. like, i couldn’t focus cause all i thought about was like “wait idek ny gender lowkey.” like maybe i’m blowing things out of proportion and i’m just a guy with like feminine features. but also like shit actually got me panicking i just felt like denial and i kept on thinking “denial is a river in egypt” and i would do things and i’m like bruh i gotta stop doing that that’s like girly. like bro. i actually don’t even know anymore. i’m much calmer now about it but i was hella anxious and stressed about it. i ended up telling amina about it cause she was there right after and honestly i trust amina a lot. can’t lie, one of the closest friends i have at ubc. and yeah she didn’t say much but i needed to get it out. and then she was like “aren’t you a femboy” and then i was like brooooo don’t say that like i can’t hear this rn. like bro. i can’t. like i actually have no idea. and i’m kinda scared i’m just blowing things out of proportion. but i actually dk like what i want to look like. like i’m fine being fucking diced. but kike the other day i was like thinking “wearing makeup is like being jacked cause like you put a lot of effort in and it makes you feel confident even if ppl don’t see it.” or i’m like “damn i wanna grow my hair</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

good&#064;technique and hammies looking good. uhh second slide was me accidentally cutting myself with my nail cause i scratched myself too hard. not tryna be like attention seeking and being like bro omg life sucks i need support but like i just wanted to show it bc when i realized i cut myself (which was after my set) i was like bro i gotta fucking relax i am not letting myself ruin my relationship with the gym if i do that i will be so sad. also first time i actually cut myself but it’s also by accident, like i meant to scratch myself but not cut. idk. just realized that i needed to&#064;fucking chill after that. but after that, was just a really low day. like probs one of my worst days in two months. idk just couldn’t escape my thoughts and cried a little. just lonely ig. and honestly it was really bad like i just felt so unable to do anything. cause idk my thoughts were just consuming me. and i just felt so lonely and like tryna get a gf. okay mood just fucking changed immediately, just got an 82 on my econ midterm. fml lowkey but that midterm was way harder so i’m pre sure i’m getting curved up. but like damn fuck. hopefully get curved up a lot. kinda madge tho did 12% worse it was harder but damn. i wanna know class avg now. also, putting this later cause this mf prob wants to keep it lowkey but anytime i post i’m really sad on my story this stephen guy texts me and starts a convo. it’s actually really nice bc i get to banter with him for like two hours and just a really nice gesture. this guy prob thinks he’s smooth or smth but idk i really appreciate it. like i saw his text and i was honestly pre happy just cause ik it was intentional. yeah not tryna be too sappy or like cringe about it but yeah it’s nice. and honestly day is a lot better. don’t feel as shit. today would’ve been a mald post without him tbh. which is v sappy. but true. need to be kinder to myself tho. will not let my relationship with the gym be ruined like badminton.</div><div

working on my cardigan, and it’s still not done. want to add buttons but i will do later sometime. not really in the mood to do it rn, just tired bc i’ve literally spent the entire day sewing. also, i added pockets but i abs despised how they looked so i ripped them off. they looked so bad. i think this fabric and pockets is just a no no. maybe if it was sewn differently but i think i just like it a lot without pockets. but it basically cost me like 4 hours. just cause ripping takes a long time and adding the pockets would be too. before i would’ve been really frustrated but honestly, anytime i’m ripping i’m literally just telling myself encouraging words. like i be ripping being like, this just life dawg, people that perfect restarting are people that perfect finishing. it’s honestly therapeutic ripping, even tho it’s quite literally showing me all the time i wasted. so immensely proud of myself since this was my first project. and i’m so excited to make more. prob won’t for two weeks just cause finals are coming up. will work on small projects here and there. but once i go back to calgary. i’m going ham. literally gonna sew everyday. and it’s gonna be lit. also i love being jacked cause anytime i’m confident and happy i just flex in the mirror and feel more confident. also i think it looks a lot better in person than in pics</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a

not make it happy but ik at the end of ill be able to live thru it. which is like way diff from before bc i would just be like im not gonna make it. but ik i will. but like genuinely, after this photo of the cardigan i just started flexing in the mirror bc i was so happy. like how can i, be jacked, creative, intelligent and mature. like dawg. god made me 5’7.5 cause he knows i would be a menace to every girl that talked to me. okay im done stroking my own cock. but like bro. idk. like nobody deserves me fr. idk. fr tho it does make me feel lonely knowing that i don’t really have anyone. and ig

slides is me working on making a cardigan. hopefully it turns out wel. anyways, i went to this girl to the gym (a girl&#064;im not trying to make any moves on and is extremely mentally ill but in denial) and i was just talking about uni and whatever. and i was just like “yeah i feel like i’ve figured a lot of myself out so my first year experience is kinda diff which is really cringe to say but true.” and then she was like “yeah that’s true, im a psych major and you’re just really self-reflective.” and then i died of cringe. like first of all, you ain’t even a psych major, you’re a first year who still needs to apply for your major. so your undecided. second, there’s fucking levels to this. like bro, you’re not even an undergrad psych major and you’re tryna use that as a way of justifying your point. like nice try buddy but an undergrad does not make you qualified to start using that as a justification. and you don’t even have that. third, i legit got a therapist so like you’re fucking 1 class of psych probs don’t got shit in my 2 years of therapy buddy. like bro, i could prob be a better therapist simply bc i’ve been to therapy buddy. like bro, i just died of cringe when she said that. it’s like when mfs get they undergrad in neuroscience or physics, and all of a sudden they’re a neuroscientist or physicists. like buddy, you don’t know shit. you can start talking once you get atleast a masters. okay honestly, it’s not that cringe but i just find it so cringe that she has to use a qualification she doesn’t even have to try to justify her point. if she didn’t say that, i would prob accept what she said. but bc i just died of cringe. and then she was like coping bc she’s like, “i did a psych internship at uni of washington” like buddy. you’re an intern. like they prob paid you to be the one that taking the notes. or like the one that did whatever howard did, like fucking digitalizing documents. like do you see howard fucking saying this shit. nah. okay. anyways, i haven’t been saying a lot on this spam bc i’ve literally been too busy sewing. but i had to say this bc this was a too diesofcringe</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

and my technique is getting better. but like highkey i be grunting and moaning like a mf in there. kinda regret doing legs tho bc im so exhausted rn. like genuinely so exhausted. and i have to study for french and lowkey i just don’t want to. i just kinda want to ball can’t lie. also so addicted to super auto pets. game is so woach. like i open the game and i get stuck in the vortex for 40 min.

back double bi: back is way more defined. traps are way bigger. teres and rear delts are way more defined. it’s insane. literally was cumming in my pants looking at this vid

lat spread: okay wtf. my lats are just way bigger. like just way fucking bigger. v-shape is too insane rn.

most muscular: traps are more defined and triceps too. more stritstions on shoulders.

cbum pose: arms just look better idk. but lats seems to go farther down my body. generally pre good

really happy with back progress</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/316346920_206588651823297_1142997228998194885_n_17970732985933099.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202211/316346920_206588651823297_1142997228998194885_n_17970732985933099.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAE3bItDlYEBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8yX3YxEQB17gcA_17957970185316906" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAE3bItDlYEBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8yX3YxEQB17gcA_17957970185316906"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAG5mZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17985726754661610" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAG5mZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17985726754661610"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAFKn752yLRBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17979327316804616" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAFKn752yLRBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17979327316804616"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAICj1wo9cKRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17979894862753731" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAICj1wo9cKRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17979894862753731"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdACRBiTdLxqhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17979627736793551" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdACRBiTdLxqhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17979627736793551"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAGIgxJul41RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18024387004442287" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAGIgxJul41RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18024387004442287"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdACmZmZmZmZhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17931152741472496" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdACmZmZmZmZhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17931152741472496"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAG7tkWhysCBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17937374963364541" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/FQIoAkMzLBdAG7tkWhysCBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17937374963364541"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Nov 22, 2022, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">haaaaiiii :3
no flex pic: funny story. this month i got sick and i lost 8lbs. and i basically gained it all back. so ye. shoulders bigger and chest more defined i think.

front double bi: i think my waist looks smaller so bette tv-shaper. biceps are better i think. that’s about it

chest flex: chest looks a bit bigger. better posing generally but i think bicep vein popping off harder

tricep flex: think i’m way leaner now bc you can see like the obliques muscles and my ribs and that. more visible bicep and tricep separation. abs also looks better. and bigger and more stritstions shoulders

with the content first for you guys. basically went to the gym again yesterday with all the girls, not bc i really wanted to be there but bc i lowkey wanted to talk to anisha more. and highkey it kinda worked. cause after, i was talking to anisha alone while we were eating cause everyone had to do their own thing. and she literally spent like 2 hours just bitching about this girl named ginny, which was honestly really entertaining cause i hate her sm too. just some really entertaining shit. and then i asked her like “is navya okay?” cause she just seems very out of it mentally. and like i opened a can of worms bc like i literally felt like i was getting trauma dumped by anisha through talking about navya’s trauma. like navya is going thru it and like idk literally the only thing i was thinking about is like this shit is not sustainable and she’s gonna snap and attempt. idk i was just also trying to reassure anisha that she’s doing the most she can, bc at the end of the day navya is not accepting her help. but yeah, after that we ended up just talking about how we both got daddy issues. shit was kinda nice no lie. just talking about how our parents were ass and i also touched on how i tried to kms. and like after that, mr cringe gym bro just started ranting to her about how like the gym helps me with my mental health a lot. and i was like yeah i want to help others have the gym mean the same thing and i think a big part is just pushing yourself real hard. and i had real W rizz moment there cause i was like “yeah we should go alone sometime so i can actually really push you and help you out personally.” and it kinda worked. we were supposed to go gym today but her mom came to campus so she’s busy. but ye, she honestly seems really interested in actually getting to know me, like even tho she had a lot of work done she actually seemed like she was contemplating going to commons to “study” with me. but also she’s not confrontational which makes me hella insecure about whether she actually likes talking to me or not. can’t lie, before i just wanted to fuck but now i do want to get to</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

gym sesh with like 4 girls. and it wasn’t as mid as i thought. lowkey the best part was i basically got like $80 out of it cause i referred them. like it’s too fucking lit. but honestly, it wasn’t as cancer as i thought. mainly cause it took them like a 1.5 hours to sign up for the membership, which is like pre good bc i actually got most of my workout in. and then after, i just taught them random equipment which was fine. also, even tho ik i didn’t really want to try to fuck, i cleaned my room hella and basically used that as motivation. like nowadays, i just find the most dumb and unrealistic things to motivate axtions i actually have to do bc ik ill get dopamine after, it’s just hard for my brain to like get started. so yeah, it helped me make my room really clean. but also, got a lot of female validation. can’t lie, these girls be hyping me up like crazy and it’s like music to my ears. so like, it’s actually pre fun cause i just get hyped up hella. and i’m like yeah i’m him. no kap. but they kinda be treating me like i’m their friend, like one of the girls. which is good like that’s actually pre nice. but also like idk maybe tryna fuck anisha. but also idk. basically what happens with me is that most of the time i’m so indifferent, and then like the 1% when i’m horny i’m like yeah. but after i’m just like bruh idc anymore. but idk she be hyping me up the most, which like a W. but also like an L cause it’s so friendly. anyways, feeling like the gay guy friend. idgaf tho tbh.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">okay i’m making this post cause i accidentally am going to a gym sesh tmmrw with 4 girls. okay so basically what happened was like i pulled up to study, and there was basically a bunch of girls i didn’t know. and i was the only guy there so they just started spilling tea on all these guys and i was just listening and gossiping about them. the most interesting one was this like really creepy guy and it was just so insane to hear about how much of a creep he is. anyways, can’t lie i didn’t talk at all, i was way too tired to contribute to the convo and couldn’t really cause they were just talking about ppl i didn’t know about. but shit was still hella interesting. anyways, they started talking about the gym and one of the girls (which i knew earlier and is actually really pretty) was like do yk this guy is actually shredded. and then showed everyone my main ig post of me flexing. which was honestly kinda embarrassing. tbh was like, bro this is way too much female attention for me. but anyways, this girl named navia was like i’m getting a golds membership with anisha tmmrw do you want to go with me. and i’m just like sure i’ll do leg day. but like lowkey, she also convinced these two other girls to come and now i’m just kinda overwhelmed cause i actually wanna workout. and i don’t want to bring like 4 girls to the gym. esp cause the other two don’t really seem like they want to go. idk man. like it would be fine if it was like two but four is just too much. anyways, actually got sm female attention tmmrw. shit was kinda insane and boosting my ego. but also it’s like bro, i kinda just want to go to the gym. but also i lowkey wanna fuck anisha. but like not date. but also idek. anyways, it was honestly pre fun hearing these woman gossip. and ig i had insane rizz cause i’m bringing 4 girls to the gym. actually, i honestly negative rizzed them just cause of how i reacted when this anisha girl was showing off my physique. and lowkey, ion even wanna go. but yeah, first post where i actually somehow seem like a player with rizz. but also feel like it’d actually be fun teaching people at the gym. there’s just too much. imo.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a

this post can’t lie. just tryna kill time can’t lie. it’s been harder to find motivation to workout, i feel really good after most days but idk. getting there has been harder. the depression has also just been hitting way harder. life just feels a more lonely and i feel more isolated than ever. inthink a big part of it is how i haven’t been able to sleep well. idk just getting sub 8 hours which is not ideal for me. but idk overall i kinda just hate all my classes really. and ig i have tests coming up which is kinda nerve wracking. idk i want to get into cogs so i have to start trying pretty hard. and i want to do better in french. which sucks bc i think french is the class that brings my avg down. like bruh. honestly, i feel so tired everyday. idk maybe i’m just too used to lying in my bed all the time but i truly spend sm time in my bed. tbh tho, i think i literally put my central nervous system under so much stress when i workout that it kills my energy for the rest of the day. but i also think there’s not a lot of things in my life that bring me energy, like idk there’s no hobby that brings back energy. maybe hobby’s like don’t exist. honestly tho, the gym brings a lot of purpose to myself. i love the gym sm that i’m so careful with my relationship with it. like i try so hard not to become obsessive over progress numbers or my physique. and genuinely, i make myself say reaffirming words like “i affirm myself” “i love myself” “you put in sm effort” “the world is mine” “you’re so lucky to have the opportunity to live thru this pain” before my sets. idk, like for me the gym genuinely meets sm to me nowadays. it’s just sort of a grounding force. and it kinda sucks i haven’t been as motivated, i think life is just becoming overwhelming so it’s hard to justify a gym trip. but honestly i’ve made a lot of progress, my lats and shoulders have grown so some of my clothes are getting restrictive. which is honestly kinda dope. idk, i post my physique all the time on my story and a lot of it is for comedic effect, but a big portion is just to bc the gym is one of the only things i do for myself that</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

clothing from china (not including shipping which will be like anotha 200) just cause i felt like abs shit and hyperfixated and didn’t have any impulse control. unlucky ig. lowkey, tryna not think about how much money i spent on it but yeah. and honestly, lowkey don’t regret buying it but like i was watching this guy rep haul and it clicked that people that buy reps are consumerist losers who build into hype culture. and lowkey, im the same. idk, been honestly really hyperfixating on fashion, ngl spent another 100 on buying a sewing machine bc i want to start making my own clothes. honestly, didn’t really want to buy it but my therapist convinced me that i should. ever since uni started i haven’t been able to express myself creatively and haven’t done any hobbies. so hopefully i sew for a long time. idk probs just huge copium. but yeah, i’m really back into buying clothes, lowkey my biggest regret was not flying back to calgary bc 1. staying in van was boring asf bc nobody was here 2. i wanted to go back so i can thrift like infinite clothes. i think i really need a creative expression in my life. and i just don’t have any. so i need to start doing that so i can feel a little more fulfilled. but idk generally life is feeling really shit, had a bad gym session too today. idk. i just feel like tucking ass. and so fucking damn lonely ngl. like i just want to be loved

saying she proud of me and it makes me want to cry. shit is fucked. honestly, everyday i think about wanting to kms and i want to be like “im actually gonna do it” bc i want ppl to care. but im not

stephen sm but i haven’t talked to my irl friends in so long i feel kinda bad. literally just been mia. also the gym genuinely takes sm time out of my day it’s crazy. but honestly, feel worse off this break. like everyday i wake up and i genuinely do feel like dying most days. dk why tbh. i feel like subconsciously it’s the culmination of being sad over maria (or being sad that for now there’s no hope for a gf), being cooped up in my room for too long, the lack of irl interactions and the lack of purpose bc schools off. but yeah this break hasn’t been good, most days just fighting to get out of bed and actually do things with my life. speaking of, my motivation for the gym everyday is so dumb and changes. like yesterday, i was only able to get out of the gym bc i heard a bladerunner 2049 sigma male interlinked audio on tiktok that somehow always makes me very motivated to go to the gym. and today was literally that dumbass pegging story post that i thought about in my bed in between thoughts of wanting to blow my brains out. literally went to a gym for irony today like ICANT. also probs feel like shit bc my fav streamer, k3soju hasn’t been streaming. literally been feeling like shit the day after he took a break. it’s so absurd how much of my mental health is dependent on his stream schedule. also i need to get way more work done on this essay than i’ve done, hopefully tmmrw ill actually grind out this essay. anyways, gender identity rent probs coming up, pre sure i’m just a guy but honestly sometimes i’m tryna do things like a girl. sometimes i just wanna be pretty like a girl so bad. but yeah, this just the teaser for that.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">okay this not a flex post or a pity post, but like lowkey i was hella disappointed with this 92. like ik i got a question wrong so i was expecting a 96, and then i got this 92 and i genuinely got so tilted. and it’s really bad, lately been getting really obsessed with numbers and not really being forgiving to myself. even at the gym, if i’m not progressing as fast as i want or regressing i get really angry. it’s really easy to just get caught up with arbitrary numbers and forget the original purpose of why i’m doing things, im in uni bc i want to challenge myself and learn and i go to the gym bc i love the pain and being present. the numbers can indicate progress but it’s just becoming obsessive. idk had a long talk about it with my therapist. but idk it’s just so easy to let an objective thing measure my worth bc it’s objective. it’s conditional but it’s objective. like idk, nobody really tells me they’re proud of me or anything and i rarely tell myself that either. and that’s really hard for me to do so i just try to rely on numbers to fill the void. anyways, i’ve been honestly meaning to write on this spam a lot more but i haven’t been able to find the motivation. literally will think of things i want to rant about throughout the day but never get to it. 

rn in uni im really cutting my circle and introverting hard. i forgot how much time i actually spend in my room but now that uni is no longer new, i’ve began spending more time in my room. i forget that in hs, if it i wasn’t at school i was lying in my bed. maybe not the best habit, i used to actually do more but this habit developed ever since i got depressed. haven’t been able to break it but also being productive all the time is overrated. idk, don’t really want to put in the effort of talking to all these people anymore. don’t even feel like talking to more girls in hopes of finding a gf, just too tired to put in effort in meeting new ppl tbh.

had 3 meals (coincidentally) with zander yesterday and it was kinda lit. talked to him for basically like 3 hours. honestly, we don’t have any like arbitrary thing we connect on. like we never rip some bs and talk about our interests. but it’s nice talking to him</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">ig this will be my last rant about maria. took a big L today ig. idk she just mentioned she had a bf and honestly it caught me pre off guard and i still wanted to be friendly with her but i was like lowkey just being like fml in my head. hopefully we still remain friends. honestly, i was expecting something to go wrong so it didn’t really hit me that hard at first. lowkey what kinda hit me hard was literally going on this spam account and feeling like i lowkey disappointed all my friends. like idk man, i hyped this girl up sm and i feel kinda bad being like yeah i took the L. but you guys did push me out my comfort zone so ig it’s worth. i shouldn’t even be apologizing for this but like sorry for getting your hopes up. maybe i’m coping out of my mind, but now that i’m not extremely infatuated with her there are things that i don’t really like. our convos can be so hit or miss sometimes and it’s really uncomfortable when it’s a miss. and honestly, she kinda seems like a polarized commie that can’t really back up her points. like she’s not that smart tbh. and i’ve mentioned that before. like one time my econ teacher was talking about the chinese famine that happens through mao and she clearly said “im not saying a centrally economy is bad but this is what happens if it’s done poorly.” and i was like fair. and idk i was talking to her after class and she was like kinda defending communism and not really taking another perspective and lowkey in my head i was like “bruh i’ve been way too much generational trauma that i can’t deal with this.” or todays walk home she was just talking about how she would spew conspiracy theories in the middle of social 30 and lowkey i was roasting her cause my ass do not want to listen to some random conspiracy in the middle of class. like i’m lowkey an unironic 9/11 is likely an inside job believer, but you cannot catch spewing that bs in the middle of class. idk just an ick that she would interrupt class to make some out of pocket arguments. generally, she seems like a chronically online leftist with no brain. this is not to take away our convos, sometimes they are really good and generally she’s really cool. i still really like her</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202211/314526098_136279048917030_1473280052381405862_n_18117794275293672.jpg"><img

insane pic of my forearms. had such a good gym sesh today, was so fucking happy dancing and shit and just smiling. my walk home was the best, i was just so happy so i became unhinged asf and just visible lip syncing some loona and ecco2k. was cringe asf but i just imagined i was in my main character music video/movie type shit. was the best walk home literally was so happy. felt amazing. anyways, really nervous cause i need to&#064;follow up with studying with maria. so i have to text her. also idk where would be a cute place to study, like i’m thinking forestry building but man idk. if you guys got cute study spots drop that shit in the comments. lisa said a cafe. but really nervous about following up. and nervous about everything tbh. but idk lowkey the more i talk to her the more the infatuation goes away, which is kinda expected. i’m also nervous that she think our convo halted to a standstill, or i’m just nervous she’s not as interesting as i make her out to be. like idk i feel like we do and would have good convos but last convo we had was kinda dry so idk. i overthink the last thing that happened sm it’s such a bad habit. dude i’m so infatuated with her it’s genuinely unbelievable. i don’t think i’ve ever been infatuated with a girl sm (other than emma but we don’t talk about that). anyways, think i fumbled with charlize cause our convos sucked and i ignore her too much. honestly for the better cause lowkey i didn’t want to contemplate if i wanted to fuck her. cause she has a bf so half of me was like do i even want to have sex bc not really and also do i really care about doing the morally correct thing to a random person. so yeah down not to contemplate. but also lowkey down just to edge her and bring her to&#064;my room just so i can cuddle with a girl and make out but fuck the sex. unless she made me call her mommy than i’d fold can’t lie. anyways, kinda glad i don’t have to deal with pretending i’m interested in her. this deep reflection post is never gonna happen btw. it’s just random women updates and it’s kinda bedge cant lie. just haven’t had motivation to post. but on the real, i love</div><div class="_3-95

_a6-i">okay was actually gonna write a deep reflection on how i always tend to go back to chasing arbitrary numbers as a way of defining my self-worth, but instead i will postpone that post and make a bedge ass post about girls. so bedge warning. actually first one not so bad cause it’s about maria, really happy i asked her and she said yes. and it doesn’t sound like she’s bulkshitting me bc she was like “yeah fs we should study poli or econ” and then she realized we just had our midterms for that. but idk just the way she reacted it kinda sounded like she wanted me to ask her so i’m happy. doesn’t sound like she’s bullshitting me. but problem is, i asked her to study next monday so i’m gonna have to wait. but today, idk was talking to her in class but she seemed kinda unavailable to my conversation bc she was texting her friend. kinda turned me off and lowkey makes me scared that she finna be texting while we study together. but like after, i think she was lowkey hinting about studying together then cause she was talking about how she couldn’t do her taylor series math problems. and i think she was trying to make me say that we should study rn but i wasn’t really sure. maybe it was my negative rizz. to be fair, i never learned taylor series so i would’ve embarrassed myself and also i was really tired and wanted to go home and nap. maybe cockblocked myself. also today was the first time i talked to charlize in two weeks. she actually seems interested in me, she like sat beside me and i didn’t talk to her for like two hours cause i was busy doing my essay. but it seemed like she wanted to and ended up starting a convo. it was hella boring tho, like now ik she’s a horse girl and her moms a horse girl and like she’s boring asf. she seems theoretically interesting asf but really she’s boring. we have decently similar music taste, she likes bojack horseman idk seemw kinda indie. or like how she knows a cast member from riverdale and she went to la and lived in lil huddy’s house and met his friends. and her celeb friend payed for her trip. but she’s so boring. the entire time, im just sitting there like this woman is so boring. idk how. but she is. and then after me and</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202211/GJy1txK1xoZ7k90BAJJdHmLxq8gbkYLAAAF_17938523792520049" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank"

writing bc i want to rant about something that i forgot about. tend to think about rants throughout the day but i usually forget them at the end. so basically, the day of i highley was contemplating whether or not to post on my main. and like after the shower it kinda hit me. idk i always feel like i have these moments where i actually remember, like yeah i had psychosis on shrooms but than i actually remembered what it felt like and how i felt for a moment and im like holy fuck that was too insane. same thing here, yeah i can remember my mentality and everything but i actually kinda remembered how i felt. and felt that way. and it just made me realize like how much has changed. it’s so absurd that in simply two years, i actually want to live most days. like i genuinely forget about the fact that i didn’t think i was going to make out of hs or have a relationship with my family or just have friends. like i genuinely didn’t think i was going to make it. and that’s so absurd. that i thought that’s all my life was. and it’s so absurd that all i thought about my life was winning this rat race of capitalism. genuinely so insane to me. idk, im still so surprised of how i used to think things not so long ago. and like when that hit i was like honestly fuck it let’s make the post. bc it’s cringe. but it’s true. like i’ve made such a difference in my life in the last two years and it’s so absurd and insane. like genuinely unbelievable. like i’m in disbelief. anyways, my poli midterm was so easy i finished it in 8 min and just sat there looking over my answers. genuinely felt disrespected an exam can be so easy and used 0% of my brain and didn’t critically think at all. social 30 is harder than poli. like idk, feel like that exam just wasted my time and showed me how much time i wasted studying. like it’s literally just basic political shit. genuinely so frustrating. that that was the exam. just feel like i invested sm time for nothing. so academically unfulfilled it’s not even funny.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202210/313213794_484139827011421_3089966423181057093_n_17969248813794702.jpg"><img

_a6-i">poli midterm tmmrw. kinda sketched cause it’s only 25 mc questions but whatever we ball. hopefully i do well. honestly, had a pretty good time yesterday, as per usual getting really fucked is really fun. think i just hate going home, remember how lonely i am and it kinda kills me every time. esp cause lisa was texting me how she missed me and i just got sad too. it’s nice tho, missing everyone once in a while. i like remembering the people in my life and it reminds me to put more effort into talking to them. speaking of, called stephen and we batchested over worlds today. watched drx fucking dick gen.g. really hoping they win next weekend but t1 is looking really good. it’s honestly weird with stephen, cause somehow we just talk about like the fortune 500 companies and we just talk about politics for some reason. but its hella entertaining. also flamed the shit out of his major cause i was like smoge take, but like why does entrepreneurship companies have sm money? idk kinda funny. it’s so weird how i just end up talking about some random chinese politics to him, but so entertaining. no kap. also watching worlds is fun bc lowkey, worlds is so fucking boring sometimes cause these korean teams make sure nothing happens for 60% of the game. so we just banter for 60% of the tome. truly based. can’t wait to watch with him next week. but lowkey, want to play a video game around weekly with him, idk talking to him sm fun. also want to call lisa. and howard but this guy seems hella busy in business and eng. plus with howard, idk i never have to talk to him all the time. every time we talk it seems like we never stopped talking and our relationship is just kinda that way. anyways, life isn’t the best rn but it’s not too horrible. just nervous to ask out this maria girl. it’s not a big deal but if i get rejected it’ll hurt. but also talking to my therapist and going to gym tmmrw. so we will get over it</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

shit is way more of a grind than science would’ve been, likke buddys gotta read sm. like highley, in science i would just not study cause i can learn things way faster. but in arts, i still gotta read that bitch. i’ll ask maria to hang out on monday. lowkey my friends be pressing me (and my sister) to like ask her to hang out or make a move, and like lowkey i’m just being a bitch. idk i def need to ask her to do that. highkey tho, i’ve been getting rejected by girls i actually like having convos with, so many confidence with this one is super low. but i’ll just ball it out whatever.z but idk, zander (sorry for calling you out) telling me i lowkey should ask her for a slumber party, but ion even want that tbh. like im still seeing if i like her as friend or like something more, and i don’t want to put that impression on her. also, idk her that well to be comfortable and i actually like her. idk, i’d ask a slumber party for a girl i lowkey didn’t care about but not for someone i’m like decently invested in getting to know. i think this is why i never see myself hooking up, i don’t actually want to ask people i’m interested and want to take it slow, and i can’t see myself talking to people that i’m not interested and entertain convo and put a facade to hookup with her. but than again i also hooked up with tamara so i’m not one to talk. anyways, i lowkey was shitting on this guy named alex. he was really obnoxious and loud when i met him but he’s actually pre cool. def chilled on his obnoxiousness so he’s not too bad. uhh, main post is cool ig, just gotta show all these mfs im lowkey jacked and mentally i’ll and unhinged. also my veins be fucking popping shit is insane. but like i saw maria liked my post, and i got nervous and shit and lowkey feel like kicking my legs. highkey, i don’t want to hang out with her bc if she stays this idealized woman in my head i’m fucking down. shit is so fun. idk she seems so cool and mysterious unironically. i asked her what she was doing for halloween and she’s like “yeah just going to this underground punk concert that might be in an</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

still contemplating on whether or not i should post. lowkey i need this kai guy to bail me out and comment “2 year anniversary of what?” for me even tho it’s hella cringe cause the comment is fabricated but it’s all g. honestly, wanting to post just to feel pretty like a girl, but be handsome like a guy. like mr ocean said “my guy pretty like a girl, and he got fight stories to tell.. i see both sides like chanel.” idk for me i really want to feel pretty like a girl. but i love how masculine i look. like i wouldn’t want to dress feminine, i just want to feel feminine. but also i don’t really want to make this post bc like highley, am i really that pretty? like buddy what if i just destroy everyone’s eyes yk what i’m saying? and it ends up being cringe. i mean lowkey post the post is cringe but if anyone calls me out they don’t respect mental health. cause it has the facade of a mental health progression but really it’s a post about me tryna feel pretty and be cringe. truly based or what. Idk really need some input here on whether or not i should post. and gotta think about what pics to post. also i’m feeling really overwhelmed rn even tho i know i’m not. i know i can do everything but i think the vyvanse is making me feel more anxious. combined with the fact that also like 2 hours ago i accidentally dropped literally all my courses and was enrolled in like 2 fucking courses. thankfully, the arts advising was free and around 30 min after i fucked up but that was the longest 30 min of my life. i think on the outside i kept it together, but deep down i thought i was bouta get dropped out. i’m honestly anxious if i can get into cogs but also i looked at my hs grades and technically i have a 97% avg and i’m in arts. like i’m just piss chilling. jk i still need to work hard and honestly i want to get into cogs early so i don’t have to worry about my grades sm. but the earliest i can get in is second year first sem and that’s if i decide to take 6 courses next sem. idk man. but honestly gotta stop thinking about everything and be in the present, pretty exhausted and there’s a lot of..</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202210/GL1toxLxEcwUNl0CAN2QiORBleQ9bkYLAAAF_17939732828295359" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202210/GL1toxLxEcwUNl0CAN2QiORBleQ9bkYLAAAF_17939732828295359"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202210/313255662_5608466242533187_7385965411140812728_n_17849366246844033.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202210/312828235_1287185185431797_68149999342220802_n_18221972614086490.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202210/312828235_1287185185431797_68149999342220802_n_18221972614086490.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Oct 26, 2022, 1:52 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">uhh gonna start off with this random bitch. this guy at the front desk was giving me sm attitude it was honestly kinda funny but shit lowkey tilted me. wish things like this tilted me less and that i found it funny. cause i do find it really funny how this guy is power tripping so hard over his min wage job and just having attitude for no reason. i really need to stop being upset over the fact i’m upset but it annoys me he lowkey living in my head rent free. but yeah idk i genuinely find it so weird how this guy can have sm attitude all the time. isn’t it exhausting? anyways, i had a thought where i was like “am i underachieving myself by being in ubc? what if i failed myself and am a failure? what if things aren’t supposed to be this easy and they are bc i didn’t try hard enough to be in a better place?” honestly i think it’s my confirmation bias going off, like i just do mental gymnastics to confirm that i’m a failure. but idk, it’s scary to think that i might’ve underachieved myself. but i look back at hs and i don’t really regret how little i worked. like i spent a long time recovering mentally and learned a lot about myself emotionally so it didn’t really feel like time wasted. along with that, i’ve never been one to try hard and why i try hard for what? go to expensive ivy that costs my parents a fortune? live in america? waste my hs experience doing random extracurricular? idk genuinely don’t think it’s something i would want to do. and i just spent time working on other things too idk. 

one thing about not being depressed anymore is it’s so hard to be hygienic. like when i was depressed i just simply wasn’t hygienic cause like bro i’m malding in my bed everyday. but now trying to clean my room and do laundry requires sm fucking motivation. genuinely very hard thing to do. i think that and my adhd not wanting to do mundane tasks make it so hard to get into a habit of being hygienic. kinda disgusting but idk. 

honestly kinda getting sick of olivia. she talks in a way that inherently rejects arguing so you never really get to argue with her. it’s kinda like talking to a mom and she’s like “cause i said so” but very implicitly. mainly, she is overly sassy</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202210/312837616_161075386609285_845853896658435167_n_17981339083728409.jpg"><img

back double bi: if you look back muscles around shoulder they look way bigger. so basically, upper trap, teres major and rear delt are more defined giving more definition to my back.

lat spread: finna be honest, looks no diff to me.

front double bi: relative to me, my left bicep has way more volume and actually looks even with my right. finally fixing the muscle imbalance. my right bicep (relative to me), also has way more small veins which looks so insane. vascularity more prevent in forearms. chest has more volume and lats v-shape feels better bc you can see it at the bottom.

side chest: thibk my tits look way bigger tbh. actually decently bigger. you can see more stritstions in my shoulder (esp the start). forearm and bicep looking extra demonic with the random vascularity and muscle definition.

side tricep: idk my arm just looks bigger tbh. like everything just looking bigger

_a6-i">uhh so this a .5 selfie me and charlize took. honestly, was gonna talk about how dog shit i feel and how much i want to kms, but those emotions passed so instead i’ll just talk about my 2 hour interaction with her. i don’t like talking to this woman tbh. she boring asf to talk to. like genuinely pre boring. but like it was funny cause like i joined the study sesh, and there was no room so charlize made room and put me between her and sarah (the girl hitting on her) and like lowkey feel sarah was mad salty about it. and then after she left, i used earbuds that sarah lent to charlize and listened to music with her. but like i genuinely have no interest in this girl other than maybe sex if she like asked me for it (and that’s lowkey a maybe). so like you alr know buddy got insane rizz when i talk to girls i’m uninterested in. so i was looking thru her playlist and i saw father time by kendrick and she’s like “that’s the only kendrick song i have.” and i’m like “oohhh so you have daddy issues” (the chorus of father issues is “i have daddy issues”). and then she was like “yeah.” and then like she was talking about her dad and she was like “yeah my dad is from calgary and doesn’t live with me.” and then i was like connecting the dots. and then i asked her if i reminded her of her dad cause i was also from calgary and she kept on dissing me before bc im from calgary 💀. unspoken rizz what can i say. idk generally, my rizz is good with girls i don’t like bc i just say out of pocket shit and if they drop interest i literally don’t give af. but yeah i listened to music with her for two hours and honestly it was such a mid time. like idk was kinda bored and too much was happening and i just wanted to listen to music ngl. didn’t even wanna talk to her. but she’s also lowkey just no fucking personality. also she has a bf. i think she’s tryna make me one of her hoes and play me and lowkey i’m tryna do the same. also she a horse girl with female manipulator music taste. like bro she was doomed from the start. and it made so much sense, she keeps her bf a secret cause ik she want to play guys/hoe around. anyways, this girl boring asf. also i maria didn’t show

better. our convo was super fucking dry tho so like i’m prob not pursuing that. more than anything, im glad i kinda know that now, idk i didn’t really like her but it’s nice to know she’s actually boring asf to talk to. might be cringe take but, the more attractive you are , the higher tendency your personality is shit. like ugly people actually got the good personalities cause they have to actually have one to make friends. but if you pretty, you didn’t need a personality to make friends. so this is about to the weirdest ick known to man, but lowkey if you’re really fucking hot, 1. im scared to talk to you 2. you prob don’t have a personality. this rant after the first implies charlice is hot but she’s okay. but after we all hung out, i learned from the girls that actually, one of the girls named sarah is actually trying to get with her, even tho she has a bf (i didn’t know about that until now). and the thing is, sarah just wants to get with any guy she sees. and now this girl. and it made sm sense cause like sarah was lowkey cockblocking me the entire time and kinda being rude, idk forgot she swung both ways so i just interpreted as being protective of her friend. don’t really like sarah. it’s just annoying how she chases every guy she sees. like it’s interesting to hear about but recently she’s been giving me such ick energy. idk i get annoyed so easily from so many people it’s kind of a problem. but honestly after a couple of people left, i actually liked hanging out with them. i genuinely think big groups is too much for me and whenever the groups seem to slim down in size, it seems way more enjoyable for me. i also feel bad bc i feel like ppl have to accommodate for me when i’m feeling introverted/i bring the energy down. but i’m fine being by myself. it’s just hard for me to figure out when i want to spend time by myself. also, someone’s who hot and has a personality is maria. but honestly hot girls just bring up a lot of insecurity. i

named ginny who hangs out with us and she pisses me off. like genuinely fucking annoys me. idk she’s just so fucking judgemental and shit. and so political about shit it’s so fucking annoying. but mainly i hate the judgemental part, i wasn’t wearing a lot to the beach and she’s like “you’re going to get cold” and i was like ??? are you my fucking mom. also her name is fucking ginny. like bro how do you have such a dog shit name. can’t you just tell how annoying she is by listening to her name. she prob one of those kids in elementary who would be stuck up to tha teacher and be like “you forgot about the homework today” 🤓🤓. ima say it rn, ginny wants to fuck zander. like she be talking to him all the time and like also zander is like a 6’2 blonde skater (scooter) boy. idk it just makes abs no sense to me why she would hang around us when she’s like constantly calling us out. other than she’s attracted to zander. anyways i honestly don’t feel like i have that big of a crush on maria. like idk talked to her today and she’s lowkey a big yapper it’s kinda fun. and she be like making so many random marxist joke it’s kinda funny idk. i think she’s pre cool and i def want to be friends with her, but she seems so popular and everything like idk it scares me. it’s also pre crazy how she asked me for my ig, esp cause she asked me first thing. like idk it’s nice indicator that she actually wants to get to know me. and that she like actively thought about getting my ig and went out of her way to specifically get it. idk maybe i’m overthinking it but it was just nice. anyways here’s a rant about sleeping cause i’m a sleep enthusiast. like i think i value sleeping sm bc i equate it to a big part of my recovery from being depressed. like a big symptom of recovering from depression is oversleeping and like it genuinely helped sm with being depressed. so i hold such value to it. also, sleep is such a strange thing to scientist and i swear sleeping makes you way fucking

grounded with everything. idk realized i genuinely do want to be academically challenged and rn im not academically fulfilled at all. so ye. will be trying to do that. and now that i’m talking to new people ig. talked to this maria girl and genuinely do enjoy conversation with her. like she’s pretty and everything but it’s nice to talk to her about our similar worldviews. and like also she seems kinda chronically online like me so idk. it’s doomed ig. but i genuinely do want to get to know her, idk i just enjoy talking to her. she a doomer just like me. and she just says shit and i’m like i be relating hard. and there was this other girl i met named chalise (idk how to spell her name). and i just call her a female manipulator cause she be listening to female manipulator music. i met her while i was drunk too. and idk talking to her today was okay but i don’t really click with her at all. i think. idk wtf to say to her. but idk i kinda get the idea she’s interested in me but idk. we will see i don’t really like her that much. but just cause i’ve talked to two people, i def feel less stuck in my group. which is bad ig but idk it feels like i’m finally talking to two people that aren’t hella annoying. unrelated but, i’m so bad at asking for insta. i get caught in convo that i just end up forgetting i can’t lie. i think what mainly helped was talking to my therapist. i get so caught up on making my life better so urgently and just feeling like i can’t feel like ass. and she honestly grounds me a lot. and it’s honestly made me feel a lot better about everything. by just letting my lows happen. honestly scared to talk to maria, i do actually want to get to know her. but i’m pre scared she thinks i’m just hitting on her. idk. she’s also part of the youth communist

have game and it’s even harder to have game when im wasted out of my mind like how tf am i supposed to talk to people when i can’t think of a coherent thought. 2. i suck at putting myself out there. but at the same time like idk lowkey it was not a good time bc i was tryna pull. like last week was such a good time bc i was just fucked out of my mind and having a good time with my friends. but like idk i talked to like two girls that night and it was just super fucking mid. like it’s good for zander to push me out my comfort zone but i’ve kinda realized i kinda hate meeting girls when i’m wasted. i just say like dumb shit and it’s kinda doomed. it’s also like i’m dependent on if i bag a girl if i actually have a good night when it could be if i’m with my homies. but ye. i’m starting to honestly get depressed and hate uni. like i’ve spent these last two days away from my friend group and it’s honestly been better. i think they actually just drain my energy more than anything and spending my time alone i actually feel better. like today i studied by myself and i actually felt pre good about it. and then i studied with them and honestly i just got tired. also im just starting to dislike more and more people in the group. there’s this guy named eric i really don’t like, idk how to describe him other than a loser. he’s really horny and any female that comes to his site he hits on. and idk he just be giving real loser vibes. like one of my friends was giving a massage to another friend and he looks to the table and he asks “anybody wanna give me a massage” and everyone is just awkwardly silent and i just wanted to kms in that moment. like idk no hate but this guy lowkey just a loser and he’s kinda unfunny. also he’s like 3% aboriginal and he always says he’s aboriginal and i’m like no tf you are not. or when he makes out with a girl he says he “hooked up” with them. dunno guy is cringe. generally tho, the bigger group just kinda sucks. i legit hung out with them yesterday and zoned out the entire time. i think i was high but i was just zoning tf out. like i’m just not excited to wait</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

my asian friends huh? i need some fucking nerdges in my life. like bro sometimes i just wanna talk in chinese bc it’s funny and i can’t. cause everyone is not chinese. like i keep on saying 死屁股 to myself (literal translation of deadass) and i just whisper it to myself. like it’s the fucking worse. friends with too many non-chinese people. idk but i actually do feel like i click with them more. i think a major part of me that is missing is like i don’t have any geeky friends. like i’m just batchesting about worlds by myself in the cafe. also, i honestly don’t like school. every class just feels like the biggest waste of time and shit is just boring asf. like idk i kinda hate this. like yesterday i took my econ midterm (and this gonna sound so egotistical) and i was kinda nervous and shit. and kinda excited cause i’m like first uni midterm. i pull up taking my adhd meds, finish in like 30 min and am so fucking disappointed of how boring it was. like bro, i did not feel challenged at all and idk. i thought school was gonna be fun but everyday i just wanna kms even more. or challenging. but everyday i’m just twiddling my thumbs. and it honestly makes me super depressed. also if i get drunk tn i’m gonna have to see tamara for the first time in like two weeks and i don’t want to do that at all. like it’s lowkey why i don’t want to go too. like i just don’t want to see her at all. she’s just gonna kill my mood and i’m scared i’m gonna start shit or worse what if i go home with her. and related is i’m too fucking horny. maybe it’s cause i have nothing to do all day but like bro i actually hate being this fucking horny all the time. like genuinely it’s not a good time. and like honestly i do not be wanting a hookup. like i feel like in order to get one, i have to act like

fighting for consciousness rn and my system is so fatigue. and then i do the set and i start creaming over the pain and the adrenaline just rushes over me. and the confidence i get from legs is insane. but literally after my workout my system was so fucking fatigued i think i just spent like 3 hours just not doing anything trying to recover from the amount of stress i put my central nervous system under. was just zoning out and shit and trying to recover honestly. i saw a girl with like e by ecco2k and like drain gang on it and zander told me to like talk to her but lowkey 1. i’m lowkey too much of a bitch to go up to girls and talk to them tbh 2. she was not that pretty 😵‍💫 3. if you listen to drain it’s lowkey an ick like why would you say that proudly tbh like you have to be apprehensive about the fact you drain. it’s just cringe idk. also talking to people i actually like from western feels so refreshing. like i actually talk to amina when i see her and it’s so nice for some reason. to just talk idk. feels way better just cause ik her. bc like idk there’s that trust over time and knowing that the convo won’t be awkward. or like lowkey jenna. talking to her is honestly really nice. sometimes it’s kinda strained but it’s okay. and this finna sound weird but strangely i can see myself dating her in like fourth year. not like i want to but like some prophetic shit. idk prob not tho but it’s weird how that thought went into my brain. also one thing about university is that i haven’t woken up and there hasn’t been something wrong with my body. like my body is sick and like lowkey a lot of skin is peeling off and the back of my neck is like infected and it’s just fucking annoying feeling like my body is not optimal everyday. i wanna wake up and feel

insane idk. mainly just really wanting a relationship, like literally lowkey spent half the day just making fake scenarios in my head with nobody and then getting depressed cause they’re fake scenarios. i think what i crave most is like the ability to show how soft i am. like genuinely, im actually such a fucking softie. and i express it in such lowkey ways, im lowkey obsessed with doraemon and i have a pikachu behind my phone cause he be cute asf. and i haven’t expressed that in so long. think that’s what i miss the most with tamara, like obv i realized she wouldn’t appreciate how soft i was but it was nice to express it for just a bit. speaking of tamara, i haven’t seen her in two weeks, idk if she’s been intentionally avoiding me or just off the grid but i’ve been hanging around her friends and she’s never there. honestly really fucking glad, her presence makes me upset honestly. i think i’m honestly obsessed with how i’m really am completely contrasting how i act, like how i act is still me but idk it’s kinda ironic and funny that i’m just such a different guy underneath all the layers. and i think it kinda kills me that nobody gets to unpack it. for example i like wearing baggy clothes bc i like the look but i always imagine a girl peeling back the layers of clothing and just revealing how jacked i am. or like how i’m kinda bitchy on the outside sometimes but really am just a big softie. this inability to express parts of myself just feels kinda bad honestly. and i wish i had people that i feel like i could. also, i fucking hate being popular in my residence. like i hate the fact i say hi to like atleast 3 people eating lunch and pretending to like them. and this hardy guy basically follows me around bc we have 3 classes together and he follows me to eat after class. so fucking cringe. like i hate how i just have to pretend to like the small talk im making. i’m literally saying hi to people that i forgot i even met. just bc they said hi to me. like i literally dk…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202210/309877746_686704792400564_6231485189055590486_n_18009373342472069.jpg"><img

but i’m prob gonna drink tn cause idk. lowkey don’t want to but i’m just gonna be rotting in my bed instead. felt really lonely after the gym, a lot of it was literally just sm fatigue that it hurts. and honestly i feel like this vyvanse is fucking my sleep schedule, might just go cold turkey again. not getting nearly enough sleep. esp cause i feel like i’m just hyper focusing on random things too. and bc my brain is so active i feel like i should be getting a lot more sleep. maybe it’s still getting used to the meds but idk. just want to slee more tbh. plus i’m like able to focus but lowkey exhausted during the day. not the fucking move honestly. maybe a lower dosage would be better. i have a theory that i get violently drunk and talk to random girls in hopes of not even hooking up with them but just cuddling with me bc i have mommy issues and just want someone to take care of me. being drunk is like the excuse for them to take care of me. idk tho. i think i just like being turbo fucking wasted. anyways maybe drunk post tn we will see. and maybe i actually bag a girl this time. doubt. plus we’re just going to a campfire so it’s not like we going insane or anything.

stimulating enough i gotta go study. like lowkey i was having a panic attack. but lowkey it was fucking lit. but after it was chill, i didn’t crash too hard. and lowkey i felt like i was actually normal, felt pre calm relatively. but at night i started going off again but like in a really good way and i got a lot of work done but ended up trying to learn thermodynamics and do a thermo question for fun and spent like two hours. didn’t solve it tho. anyways i sat with maria today and i had a good 15 min convo with her. but it’s like that saying “never meet your hero’s” like that idealized version of her is like completely gone. she seems kinda dumb tbh. and like our convo honestly kinda sucked. there was also this girl named sara talking and she was hella annoying, she’s like the nerdy archetype who studies really hard but is a brick. and she was going off about her bf was stem brained and never studied and did well and how it was so weird and incomprehensible and i was like sitting here like awkwardly being like bro relax you describing me. but honestly maria gave me a huge ick cause the entire class she just texting ppl. idek why it was such an ick but idk just being on your phone all the time is such an ick. like class was hella boring but idk it just feels really cringe and also i think a part of me doesn’t want to get involved with her bc i feel like i would have to compete for attention. and that’s just something i’m not really willing to do. i think the image i had of her lowkey just got destroyed today and honestly kinda expected. overall tho, sometimes i just talk with dumb people and it kills me. like i was sitting with this girl at lunch and she had like such an incomprehensible bad would you rather question that made no sense. and she seems really snobby too, like she called the soup “it’s giving soup kitchen” and idk for some reason that just tilted tf out of me. and just her general behaviour. like i remember just roasting her the entire time bc i genuinely don’t like…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202210/310881870_403871668611963_3404422444705247048_n_18016177687415947.jpg"><img

like at the 180 and am like okay like idk if i really want to put in effort. also this guy that just pisses me off talks to her after class and i don’t have the effort to compete with him. there’s no

honestly i kinda want to make this 2 year anniversary post but if nobody comments what i mean it’s like bruh. also i feel like it’s bouta be cringe cause like there finna be hella fake sympathizers

lowkey cackling at him. call was just so fucking troll. honesty a good time. honestly i just need to learn to be more patient. like idk i just want a gf, want good friends but those take time. and like yeah it’s been so long since i’ve had those things but relationships take a long time to form or to find. and i just gotta take it a day at a time. and rn i’m lowkey thriving in my circumstances

her arm around her the entire time cause i was too drunk to walk and i kept asking her if it was okay and she said it was. and lowkey i asked her if she wanted to come over and cuddle. explains a lot tho tbh. but yeah so fucking awkward LMAO. wish she just told me earlier cause then it wouldn’t have been so weird. but anyways, onto the next girl which is this girl named maria and she’s from calgary. bro like highley churchill actually got some mad cuties. like she is so pretty i’m not even joking. like she lowkey my type it’s like kinda scary cause ima tell her i listen to bladee and she will get scared of me. but like i’ve always noticed her in class (cause we’re the same cohort) but never really approached her. then we had a poli discussion today and she was like the only other person actually being smart and shit (ofc i was the other smart) and i’m like this is so insanely attractive i gotta talk to her. so i talked to her after our discussion and it was like general small talk but she’s nice and like walked with me for a bit. she actually pretty asf. okay time to reference something that only howard knows but recently i’ve been fucking jamming to this song called the flag is raised by bladee and ecco and there’s a part where ecco singing like “maria, maria maria maria” and it’s so hard and i sing along to it every time. but like today i sung along to the song and i realized and i was like bro this a sign from god. this happened this other time when i was in tamara dorm house tryna find her and it was everything in its right place by radiohead and it was like “im not hereeee” and i was like bro i feel like she’s not here and she wasn’t. just saying bro if i pull this intelligent baddie like it would be too fucking lit. like her being smart makes her like 10x attractive. also having a crush just makes me want to look better. gonna start actually wearing some jewelry. she so pretty she intimidate me dawg. anyways yeah honestly first year is really fun, just meeting so many people is so exhilarating and talking to random mfs is so fun. like talking to my therapist about</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

fuck sex) and just sleep with them. anyways this long weekend felt really long. and i feel like i just want a relationship. like idk. feel like i’ve grown so much and i just want someone i can actually talk to. honestly my only goal for uni is literally getting a gf. like it’s that stupid but idk, life isn’t bad but i just need that connection in my life. also i might just be a binge

high rn ig. but lowkey i don’t even feel that high. was hanging out with my friend group but tn i was just really not feeling it so i dipped. kinda feeling bad for leaving in the middle but it’s alr. called stephen the other day and he says he actually reads my post and it makes him realize he actually misses me. honestly a really heartwarming moment and like i really miss talking to him. he said that really i’m just a nerd in disguise and it’s really true. like i just miss talking about nerd shit to people. and i hate that i can’t. and it actually clicked that i dislike my friend group. like it’s not too bad but i think when everyone is all together it’s overwhelming and i don’t like the chaos that ensues. i really miss my old friends from calgary, i just can’t deal with things now. i don’t feel like i belong anywhere again and it kinda kills me. it’s so insane how stark the contrast is but it really is true. i thought i found my people and found my person but really it was just a sham. and now these feelings of not belonging anywhere have come. and honestly i’m starting to really dislike tamara. not even resent but like she’s just kind of cringe. like her braindead conversation is just not really funny, and i just don’t like her when we’re with others. she kinda makes being bi her personality and she was like being annoying about the fact she vandalized. like okay ig. and like she calls me out on something i’ve opens up about but she’s so judgemental about it instead of supportive. honestly as the day roll by i dislike her more and more. as dumb as this sounds lifting is like the only thing that matters to me. like it’s just such a constant in my life. that idk i literally live off of lifting. but ig life isn’t all bad, yesterday i hung out with the guys in the group and they are honestly really cool. i actually like them a lot. i think big friend groups aren’t my thing tbh. maybe i just need to get really drunk in order to have a good time with them. but yeah high rn so i can loathe. i honestly feel so lonely. i’m literally popular, i be saying hi to literally…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

we both acted out of our values and she could of just told me to go slower instead of being platonic. and she kinda blamed me for a lot when tbh she’s just not ready for a relationship i was giving her. like i think her not wanting to spend sm time and effort is valid but like she called me undisciplined bc i wanted to see her all the time (like my brother in christ you could’ve said no?) and when i cried that she didn’t want to be a thing she was like “you’re putting an emotional expectation on a relationship” (like mb for crying next time ill just turn off my emotions). and my therapist also said fucking the guy was really disrespectful and not worth even mentioning to me, and she’s been talking about it a lot. it’s not too bad but still, just kinda disrespectful. i don’t want to be mr nice guy, but like idk honestly i showed her a safe relationship and she ran away from it. like she cried to me and it was the first time she ever cried to a friend, and after she was like “i feel like i shouldn’t be crying to you bc i just met you.” like idk you should let yourself cry? like it’s good that you feel comfortable around me to cry. so why resist it? me and my therapist thinks she’s just not in tune of her emotions at all. she blamed me a lot for the relationship and like made me feel like it was my fault things ended. like taking things too fast. but idk, i didn’t say any commitments like i love you, i just wanted to see her a lot bc i enjoyed her presence. and like i feel like this is why i feel so okay with our thing ending. bc i genuinely felt like i acted out of my own values and did the best i could. and now i can see that she didn’t act out of her own values and instead of ending things bc of personal things, she blamed me instead. and idk, i feel so affirmed knowing</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202209/FQIoAkMzLBdAJBBiTdLxqhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17905403681646532" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a

fall asleep. madge honestly. lowkey done moping about it, it’s gonna be lowkey awk seeing her with our friend group. but hung out with mainly two of them today, studied together the whole day and it was honestly fun. really tiring tho. didn’t even finish what i needed to study. but like i needed today to study, literally spent the last two days moping and didn’t study at all so there it is. honestly, i actually am really appreciative that i had a week to feel seen. and i honestly did rush things a lot, maybe i shouldn’t have idk. but i wish things were different but also i feel such a confidence and relief that i didn’t date her. idk it’s not even a cope it’s like i know i shouldn’t have dated her. so i’m glad things ended the way it did tbh. hopefully we can still be friends but i lowkey feel a little bit of resentment. i’m also glad i feel like i belong in our friend group, but honestly i predict a lot of drama bc ppl lowkey there’s a lot of hookups between everyone inside so idk. kinda weird too. but overall, felt kinda shitty in the morning but feel good about the whole situation. i mean idk, i connected really hard with her but a little part of me feels like i could do better. obv i’m scared i won’t find someone but idk. i think this is just a taste of what’s to come. which is nice. it’s also nice not feeling exclusive, i mean its kinda fun talking to girls with the lowkey intention of cuffing her. speaking of, there was this football guy in the study room being so fucking cringe, he was tryna bag these girls and just trying to be funny and it was so ridiculously cringe and so ick. my friend literally told him to shut up and he was like “who said that” like he finna do something. shit was funny asf. he like saw a girl for like 2 min and didn’t talk to her and asked her friend for her snap after she left. and i was like curious about why this mf asking for a snap after seeing a girl for like 2 min and he’s like “don’t stress” like he got dibs on a girl he didn’t even talk to. shit was so funny tho it’s like infinite content. anyways ye. feeling good again tbh</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

_a6-i">honestly idek what to say rn. tbh i don’t want to make this post bc im feeling really lazy. basically have spent the last 24 hr moping or crying. had a really good week with tamara, and then yesterday night she basically said she wasn’t ready for a relationship and i honestly kinda bawled my eyes out. a little part of me is glad that i finally sobbed after so long. however, in that conversation she used my emotions against me and i honestly felt like such an emotional baggage. she downplayed my emotions highkey a lot. she had to leave bc of some serious shit, so i was just crying alone in my room until 2 am trying to figure out my thoughts. honestly had so many self-destructive thoughts and it really fucked with my response. but honestly felt like a fucking dog, swear ppl lowkey just play with me until they’re bored. idk after that i just moped the entire day and organized my thoughts and we talked about it again today. and it was more official that were just platonic friends. honestly i feel like it’s better that we are, like im still grieving that i don’t have a relationship bc i really want one but with her i think being friends is the best option. i cried again to her. but i still will always appreciate this week i had with her, idk i felt so seen and secure this week. it was nice. idk she also said after she left me she fucked this guy and we had a convo saying we’re not exclusive but like bro im literally moping in my room crying bc idk what our relationship will be like and she’s like fucking some guy. like im lowkey angry about it but not really bc it doesn’t matter tbh. it just seems disrespectful but than again we were never dating. idk just moping really hard. honestly also don’t feel like i belong anywhere, idk if i like the friend group that much. ill hang out with them and see but idk. i honestly feel horrible rn. literally almost cried just eating in cafe. i’m so bad at accepting the fact that i could do everything right and i prob won’t get into a relationship. like ik i don’t want one with her. but some part of me feels like i’m not enough for anyone. and i just wanted to finally tell someone i loved them</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202209/308832940_773897250353956_7293042769497030225_n_17977186462671620.jpg"><img

time anymore. so much has been happening, like i see this tamara girl sm that we’re both very sleep deprived and i actually have a friend group now. and they are very far from my conventional friend group, like there’s like ppl from every continent and the majority is girls. and like one time i sat with them and i literally felt like i was in mean girls. their humour is just so genuinely funny. and i actually feel like i belong tbh. but tbh, it’s lowkey too huge for me, i know by the end of the year this group is going to breakdown in separate groups and drama is going to happen and i just can’t be in a group with so many people for so long. just get too socially exhausted. but i really like them. also i feel really safe with tamara, like she’s really communicative and it makes me so comfortable with her. she tells me everything and all her thoughts and i’ve never really been in a relationship like that. but it makes me so happy she does. but what happens is there’s no mystery or pondering on what the other person is feeling, so there’s not that infatuated chase. which is honestly better, i totally rather have this adult relationship than that.</div><div class="_3-95

lisa and she’s living it up, she has a thing and like a solid group of friends. and i was like really happy for her but i like could not hide my jealousy, like i felt like her uni experience was sm better than mine and idk what i was doing wrong. and i was just jealous she was having such a good time and honestly i was pre sad about how i haven’t found anyone i click with in uni. and like i was moping about it throughout the night, until these mfs in my floor asked me if i wanted to pre for a frat. and lowkey i just wanted to go to my room and mope. but i was like fuck it, ill pre and idk foreshadowing but it’s so crazy how this tiny decision could possibly change my life forever. so i get pre drunk, lowkey don’t like my floor mates that’s well but we go to the frats. except there’s no frats tn so we end up going on top of fhis parking lot and it’s braindead asf. like i’m lowkey ready to go home. but this other group getting high pulls up and we start socializing and i started mainly talking to them bc i pissed in the parking lot and talking about how good my piss was. and there’s this girl named tamara who i lowkey knew i just fucking clicked with. like we just knew what to say. so i lowkey hover her the entire night bc i want to talk to her and she’s cute and i lowkey want to make a move but i don’t want to do it with the group watching. anyways, we end up watching a movie and my floor mates leave me (it’s weird bc i’m like the only person talking to the new group that came really) and we go watch movie with this other group. and i really fuck with them, they cool and funny lowkey. and idk we watch superbad and eat pizza and when i’m going back i’m like to tamara, “yo i’m alr in your dorm i wanna check out your room” bc lowkey i wanna talk to her. so we go to her room and it’s really nice and we talk but this entire time our conversation is really platonic but we click really hard. we’re lowkey finishing each other sentences but mainly, she’s as honest and open as i am. which is so fucking important to me. like she says what she thinks and i don’t have to ponder on what she’s…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

like sat near me in the cafe so i came up to her and asked her if she wanted to eat together. and like lowkey this girl is pretty, like she half chinese and half korean (quite literally best of both worlds) and her hair is nice can’t lie. so we’re eating together and we’re like half clicking not really, idk not fully clicked but like it’s not horrible. and she invites to me join her floor and watch a ghibli in the evening. so im like yeah sure and then later i ask her if she wants to study together. so we lowkey try hard study for like a hour and we’re both like fuck studying and we start talking. honestly, this entire day were just half clicking, the convos are kinda dry. and i honestly think we were just bored and have no friends so we just were like fuck it let’s hang out. or she just didn’t want to say not and we just hung out together. but after a while we get boba and like it was okay. honestly i think this entire time we’re both tired but we both don’t want to really leave. atleast that’s what i felt. and we talk until like the ghibli movie. and i just felt super out of place cause i was like the only guy there but we watched totoro and i fucking love that movie so i was super into it. she fell asleep tho 💀. and yeah after that we just went to our rooms. idk honestly. lowkey, im hoping this is like a lisa thing, cause i didn’t really fuck with lisa when i first met her but it got better. also a general thing, im really bad at leaving first in hang outs bc im like “what if we start clicking after i leave” and i just force myself to stay. idk. she’s really pretty tho. so that’s lowkey why i’m giving her such a big chance. like idk she’s pretty and giving me attention. okay but honestly, i don’t see myself dating this girl at all. can’t lie a little part of me wants to date her for ego reasons, but like ik that’s not gonna happen. and even tho we hung out from literally 3-9, the whole thing felt kinda platonic. like it was never romantic at any point. so i didn’t really feel like flirting even tho she’s pretty asf. there’s moments where it was fun, but idk kinda mid…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

went to two lectures and both had mfs coughing they asses off. like huh? bro just don’t go to class. and now i’m sick. lowkey too lazy to test for covid, will do that tmmrw. lowkey thought about this situation before, and i was like “bro it’s gonna be so ass being sick and having no mom.” and now i’m sick. shits ass. head hurts a lot lowkey. esp cause i went to the gym. also being sick giving me fomo highkey. also this linda girl left me on delivered. feel like ass about it can’t lie. it what it is ig. also had a dream this morning and it legit made me so depressed. fuck dreams they actually fuck with my mental. but idk. also amina was going off yesterday about the limitless potential in uni, and i agreed with her bc i’ve been feeling like that too but the group of people i was with def made me not really fuck with the msg. idk just really don’t fuck with her new friends, they kinda not my ppl and are annoying. basically have spent all day in my room. fuck this being sick shit. being

don’t want this to become a reel. anyways extremely tired rn, actually studied for 3 hours today which is the second time i actually studied. but can’t lie, it was lowkey fun. french was pre mid but i was reading this academic article about monopoly rent and how the commodification of culture creates a monopoly and subsequently homogenized the culture it exploits. honestly pre interesting stuff, hating on capitalism and shit. feel like i’ve been applying my learning to daily life more, thought about how the monopoly rent of the university made me pay $4 for a drink. or i would start saying replacing words to french to help me remember. honestly pre happy that i’m interested in what i’m learning, it helped me a lot with reading this academic article. idk shit was just interesting. honestly no ego, i think i’m honestly smarter than my classes most of the time, like they ask some questions and i legit cringe and wanna die bc the question is stupid and it’s kinda boring listening to it. so ye. also beginning to be way more individualistic, like at the gym i be like “the world is mine” or other individualistic statements. hypes me up tbh. been groaning so fucking loudly, i actually gotta chill but honestly i think i work harder than like 90% ppl there. nah fuck it i work harder than everyone else there. my bad tho for fucking with the gym environment. but honestly the gym gives me such insane confidence within myself, seeing how i work harder than everyone else affirms me so much about how much i’ve been through to be able to withstand and appreciate this pain. and it affirms me that i’m genuinely not like anyone else. i genuinely love the pain. but it’s funny asf, when i daily my last rep i’m actually filled with rage, but i’m honestly not depressed, it’s like a good rage where i’m still really happy. but i be like having temper tantrums and shit at the gym it’s so braindead. also my new style of training is way better, way more rewarding bc it focuses on less sets but way higher intensity. the pain affirms me way too much. also linda texted back so we back to talking to her.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

about this girl named angela from calgary, who i think is lowkey very cute. and she’s bsf with grace li. so today i saw grace li and was like fuck it im down to eat breakfast with her so i can meet angela. instead of that tho, i meet this girl named linda who’s honestly pre cool and we clicked. and this is the convo we had asking to get coffee. this “as friends” thing is kind of an L, but honestly i didn’t want getting coffee to be seen as a date typa thing. but it might mean she’s like completely unavailable which is an L but for now i think she just wants to say we’re both down to meet each other and not really interested. which i’m like honestly down for, i can’t really imagine dating someone just by talking to them idk. like i’ve literally just met her for a day. lowkey this linda girl is so fucking funny, i was talking about how i was really fucking wasted and how i wanted a girl to take care of me instead of hooking up, and she called me out and said “bros got the mommy issues” and shit was so fucking funny. like idk she honestly seems really fucking funny so i fuck with her hard. anyways, i saw grace li at lunch again today and this time i met angela. she’s pretty and the convo was okay with her but she’s having a talking stage with gordon zhao (a classmate from western). as god as my witness i didn’t do this out of malicious intent, but i just told her gordon lowkey talks to a lot of girls. which is true from what i seen, but she took that shit hella seriously so i was like “don’t change things just cause i said it.” but it’s so fucking troll. and there’s this other thing that requires a lot of context but essentially i also told her that she’s not on his bsf list. but idk shit was so fucking troll. like i was laughing my ass off about jt. also talked to my therapist today and she told me she was proud of me. idk if she’s supposed to say that but i’ve honestly changed a lot from hs. letting all these opportunities happen and talking to new people is a really big growth for me. so i’m happy for myself and hearing her be proud of me is kinda nice.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

really miss talking to my friends esp lisa, frats lowkey really boring and every time i’m drunk i think of how lonely i am. lowkey wanted to hook up with a girl but like too drunk to fucking function so it was all g that i didn’t. i’m just sad rn ig idk. lowkey just want ppl i actually talk to snf not random mfs i just meet. trying my abs hardest to meet people i tuck with but that’s not

think). and it involves people in my spam. a little part me wants to date lisa just so i have the security of having people that’s likes talking to me. i genuinely don’t think of her romantically at

that’s what’s going on rn. but huge mistake writing this post but fuck it i say everything anyways. talking to lisa makes me realize how my standards are, if i don’t think of her romantically how hard it for me to find somonezz i wonder how my lost affect our friendship. i hate making small talk i just want someone who actually like talking to. honestly lowkey just wanted ti bring a girl home to

conversation that’s not draining asf. lowkey at the start i was making small talk bc i was so used to it and i snapped back to normal and i just ranted to her about dumb shit and it was nice. like idk just talking to her feels so relaxing and actually energizing. and then we talked about our time in calgary and honestly my heart started aching again a bit and i actually miss her. tho i’m really trying to create new connections and click with people, it’s so nice talking to her and it makes me wish things never changed. i’m honestly kinda sad thinking about it rn. lowkey hung out with some badminton friends and they’re just way too racist and misogynistic i couldn’t deal with it. i just can’t idk. spent the entire time cooped up in my room, just really fucking tired tbh from talking to all these mfs. so i just took a day off of talking to people and going out and spent my entire day on my phone. honestly was really energizing i really needed it. did some homework today too and honestly i think the stuff i read about is actually pre interesting. it was basic genre theory and shit but it’s just kinda interesting viewing genre as how english is used in situations rather than just the form. but also french bouta be my hardest class i’m actually gonna start grinding that mf. gonna actually grind hard for french. but every other class i lowkey feel like the smartest guy in the room. had a class where everyone asked the dumbest questions and shit. idk. thinking about all my friends i’m genuinely so scared i care or reminisce more than others. it just feels shitty when you care about someone more then they do for you. and i’m just genuinely very scared of being overbearing. i’m really trying my best to find people to care about in ubc and i’m really glad i’m taking all these opportunities. but it’s really exhausting so i gotta pace myself tbh, being way too extroverted for who i actually am. also just really want a gf i can’t even lie. imagine i just sleepover with a girl everyday sounds kinda fucking lit. also i’m so jacked nowadays it is pre weird.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

learned how to play japanese mahjong which is way harder than the mahjong ik but lowkey way more fun and way more strats. lowkey feel like i’m playing tft. honestly it was pre fun and it made me realize how much opportunity i have in ubc. like i’ve been socializing so much and having so much opportunities and it’s honestly really nice. it’s really nice to go home exhausted and be like i had fun today and everything. way better than me rotting in my room. i really want to play mahjong now. generally tho there’s so much i want to do(and have to do everyday) that i feel so overwhelmed. kinda scared i won’t be able to do school work and actually do bad in school. like the program i’m thinking about getting into is cognitive systems and that’s actually a hard program. wish i chose an easy one high key. but for now i’m having a lot of fun just trying new things. like excited for phil club and idk maybe i might join another for fun. and honestly kinda excited to learn. and make new friends. and honestly idk just so much opportunity. i feel like i can be who i actually want to be. and do the things i want to do. instead of rotting at home. so this ubc shit is kinda hype. but lowkey i be talking to zero woman. shits not lit. and this mahjong club has 0 woman. so like gotta find girls to talk to lol. honestly just talking to hella people tho. feel like i actually come off as friendly now</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202209/FQIoAkMzLBdARaocrAgxJxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17961247201827359" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a

introducing myself to people and joining clubs. also talked to amina and she apologized for the whole ghosting thing. she sounded like she felt pre bad about the entire thing but honestly i’ve been over it. i’m glad she apologized tho. idk. it’s nice, hopefully i can be friends with her. first day of classes were boring but honestly i’m just going to try to make new friends. i’m legit networking so hard just so i can meet people i like. but i genuinely can’t imagine being in business and networking. just sounds so fucking hard and exhausting. everyday i’m very socially exhausted from everything. also a huge part of me wants to get into a relationship it’s bad. feel like it would just be fun cuddling with a girl and shit. idk. just really tired everyday tbh from socializing. lowkey

is that the worse feeling is feeling indifferent. like i just hate not caring makes me feel so nihilistic and shit. idk. just not based no cap. and this small talk shit is so exhausting, like it’s okay but sometimes i like smile and talk to people and i turn around and i immediately start frowning. kinda cringe. but nevertheless i feel really lonely, i think mainly bc i don’t have any friends and i haven’t hung out with anyone. lowkey just chilling in my room everyday. which is not that good i feel really lonely. but idk decided to change that and meet some new people, shit was not bad. but i just be overthinking and shit talking to these mfs. like idk they were all resident advisors so it was okay. but it’s fine ig. honestly really hesitant to say this but fuck it we ball. having all this small talk really makes me appreciate the time i had with lisa. like idk i just felt so seen at that moment and it makes me dread going to uni. just cause it took me 3 years to get like 3 friends and finding ppl to be friends with seems so exhausting idk. but i also don’t want to keep on mentioning that night with lisa. i just feel so fucking needy every time i think about it tbh, like i need her in my life. which is turbo cringe idk. like bro gets validation one time and starts going insane. i just really hope i can find people who see me as much as she did that night in uni. and thinking about how i prob won’t makes me feel so fucking lonely. also went to a frat and lowkey had a bad time. think i’m just not down for frats. rather just get drunk and talk to people. maybe i wasn’t drunk enough but music lowkey was mid, and it just wasn’t that fun dancing. shit was honestly just kinda mid i can’t lie. also don’t like seeing my sister tbh. every time i see her she just tilts me in some way. like today i was just asking how ketamine and molly feels like and she’s like “don’t do them rn you’re literally so mentally unstable unlike me.” bro i legit wanted to question mark ping her irl. like idk, i haven’t talked to her about my mental health in like a long time so she doesn’t even know. and…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

and boxed with ishaan and ethan. honestly the boxing part was so fucking fun, i lowkey wanna do that shit for sport. shit is just hype. it’s just fun using my body in an useful manner. anyways, lowkey hate meeting new people shit is so cringe. i’ve realized all the social people are in business and i lowkey just don’t like talking to 90% ppl i meet. really scared i won’t make new friends, bc i just hate talking to people. but we will see where shit takes me. idk i think i’ve just accepted this is my new life and kinda okay with it. honestly just want my parents out of my hair. i just can’t deal

posting again cause i just need to yap. this post is lowkey boring asf. was talking to myself when i realized i will talk to myself out loud just so i have someone to yap too. bro if i have kids i feel bad for them bc im gonna yap to them all day. anyways i went to best buy to buy a pro controller and i accidentally socially engineered the cashier and saved $10. i brought in like $40 worth of coins bc i wanted to get rid of all those coins. and when i came up to the cashier she looked kind of panicked and asked her what’s wrong. and she’s like “the previous customer didn’t pick up like $50 worth of change.” i can tell she’s new from her demeanour and the in training tag on her name tag. so i just comfort her or whatever. and when i’m paying i just start yapping about how cash is fake and start counting my coins. and she’s like yeah cash feels so fake to spend. and lowkey just forgot to count $10. and she’s like out here like “yeah i trust you counted right.” and then i complimented her pants. idk. cassin.spam followers when they have to hear about the literal one interaction that he had with another person that day. idk tho she was cute but i feel bad for counting wrong. anyways, i think i just want uni to come, really sick of these days where im just not talking to anyone but i feel like i’m gonna miss them. feel like i should’ve done jumpstart but ngl, feel like i would have a really bad time just cause it doesn’t sound fun. also small talking in uni is bouta be the tucking worse. thinking about that shit makes me wanna kms. today is just a want to cry day. this transitional period between my life and uni sucks. and gotta pack.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">honestly prob writing this post bc i’ve been alone all day and just need to yap. actually i talked to my therapist today and it was lowkey lit. just updated everything on my very meaningful week. and i was talking about how it’s so weird how my mentality has changed (like being thankful i’m able to miss people or thinking of my experiences now and that just being a taste of what’s to come) and she was like “your week was really high bc of the people that talked to you and saw you so they’ve def helped.” and it makes sense, it just felt like it clicked this week in terms of being positive but a lot of it is bc i felt seen. so thanks to the people that’s helped with that. and honestly i just like talking to my therapist. idk if she was supposed to but she said she was proud of me and she day one fr. but idk she’s been a part of me through my journey and it’s just nice telling her the progress im making. but honestly most of my day was spent alone, was a rest day too so i legit didn’t do anything today. maybe losing a bit of motivation to go to the gym, but honestly think i’ve just been drinking and feeling to unwell to go. even tho i’ve spent most of my summer sitting in my room not doing much, it never really sucks any less. and since everyone’s gone, it’s like i don’t even have the option to go out even if i wanted to. which sucks. i mean in uni ill prob will talk to a lot of ppl and socialize and never really be alone, but it’s not the same. i think i just spent last week with people i really enjoyed talking to, and just thinking about trying to find those people again feels so exhausting. honestly i’m back to feeling really lonely, and it genuinely does suck. but i know a lot of opportunity to make friends is ahead of me. my therapist told me to not expect anything, like good or bad and just let things happen and let my emotions happen. and honestly that’s really good advice. it’s hard to do bc you have to completely let go and say you don’t know, which is genuinely a hard thing to do. but there’s so much power in saying i don’t know. admitting your weak and uncertain just feels so powerful and really drops your own barrier and others. but idk.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/302180153_1300969677397221_3512705838751689490_n_18189641530168268.jpg"><img

really apprehensive about sad posting. i think part of me doesn’t want to feel like a hypocrite with what i’ve said when i was happy and a part of me also doesn’t want things to return to a status quo. honestly i think i am over the night with lisa and generally missing everyone, which is always bittersweet. it’s good that i’m moving to new experiences and not hanging on to the past but a part of me feels like i’m not paying enough respect to the past and my memories. like i’m almost undermining the people that were in my life by not missing them. but also i feel like i tend to be more emotional and feel like i care more than others. honestly, i think i’m really insecure about how much i care, i feel like i just tend to care more than others and when i realize they don’t care as much i just feel like a dumbass. so i’m always really apprehensive about caring, i do things in an indifferent matter to show idrc. i feel like i’m genuinely just a lot more emotional than everyone else and it feels it never really does me well. along with that, i said bye to kathie yesterday (the fort mac childhood friend that was staying at my house) and even tho i am going to miss her  i didn’t say it. i really do think of her as my little sister and she dragged me out the house a lot and made me talk to new people. it was pre exhausting on my social battery but i kinda liked it. i think the best thing about her is how willing she is to listen to me yap about random topics. i feel so self centred when i dominate conversations but i really do like to talk. just about random shit, but idk i really do like talking to her. and i remember yesterday she’s crying about jonathan and leaving calgary and i was just talking to her and i just felt like her older brother. i think i just really appreciate when people listen to me and it makes me feel really ass bc i don’t want to dominate conversations or be self centred. and highkey i just like being a therapist, kathie’s sister tina was talking about her boy problems and i was just telling her what i genuinely believed and was honest and she was like wow you’re like highkey better</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

interesting just to click bait you guys. also lisa is still on the spam and reading everything i’m bouta say (hi!) so the friend group went out for lisa and subin’s bday and we went for dinner and then a campfire after which was just me, subin, lisa and ethan. eventually it’s 4am and lowkey the only people really drunk is me and lisa so subin and ethan go in. and we’re both like piss fucking wasted and drunk. honestly super fucking drunk and were talking and having a nice heart to heart that i’ll talk about later. but eventually at 6am i’m like “you want to cuddle” and to my surprise she says yes and when we go in. so eventually we go in and we sneak up into her room to cuddle but i’m in my jeans so she lends me a pair of shorts and i looked really fucking dumb and she kept laughing at me for how dumb i looked. lowkey i was just admiring how massive my legs were but i looked so dumb and seeing her laugh so hard was kinda nice. but she’s really nervous that her parents are going to find us cuddling and i’m trying to calm her down bc lowkey i just really want to cuddle. honestly, i was really scared that i was pressuring her to cuddle with me but im pre sure i didn’t. but yeah idk i would feel really bad if she was pressured into doing it and she wanted to sleep downstairs in front of all our friends and i was like nah that’s so embarrassing let’s just risk it cause your parents won’t come in. idk hopefully i didn’t pressure her too much by making her stay upstairs. but we cuddled for a bit (i wasn’t a little spoon even tho i told her i was the one with mommy issues 😒) and it was honestly really nice, it’s been a long time since i’ve cuddled anybody and just being close to her was nice. but eventually she convinces me to cuddle downstairs and when we go downstairs she’s like i’m going to cuddle with subin for a bit and i might come cuddle with you. so i slept alone for a bit, but lowkey i still wanted to cuddle so i went into their room and told her ill miss her bc she’s leaving that night. and i connected really hard with her throughout the night and we just hugged for a bit bc</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

caption. my bad for posting sm tho on the real! literally been spam posting bc i can’t sleep at night. it’s raining pre hard and honestly shits a vibe, seeing all the water on my window and the fact it hasn’t rained in so long. was talking to my therapist about this but i made up a new term. i was just yapping and i was like “the happiness to cost ratio” which is honestly just a good way to evaluate if you want to do something. i stressed my balls off trying to make plans for tomorrow but i’m bouta spend infinite money just to not have a good time. not lit. if drama happens it’s so bedge. but i’ve been thi king about it and i think i’m lowkey never gonna travel. the happiness to cost ratio is just not it, i feel like personally i’d rather improve my life a little bit by buying permanent items or getting my life in a better place then going on vacation. and like with vacations it’s not like it’s always fun, there’s going to be some boring or upsetting things so idk if the fun makes up for how much it costs. my therapist thinks this is a based take. like idk genuinely maybe i do kinda want to see the world but a big part of me also just wants to be able to live a better current life instead of going somewhere for a bit and feeling all that joy. along with that i really do believe some of the most impactful memories are bc of the individuals within those memories and not the places i was in. so idk, i’d rather not vacation. i also realized i kinda fucked up course registration, honestly it’s not a huge deal and i learned a lot about courses and what i want to do. thinking i’m leaning heavily on a dual arts and science major bc i think i really enjoy both. also genuinely really proud of my progress! it’s insane how far i’ve gotten with my physique and it’s just nice seeing improvements even if they are small. it’s just a visual way of remembering how far i’ve come. honestly i’m really ready for this new phase of life to start. i’ve come to accept that things are going to change and even tho things might not get better, there will be more opportunities for me to improve. along…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

back double bi: v-shape is way more intense, lats way more developed it’s kinda insane. upper back muscles more defined generally but, rear self and traps have lots of development. 

back lat spread: we can really see the upper lat development with this v-shape here. it’s fucking insane. my waist looks even sluttier than before. pogo.

most muscular: bro the fucking veins are just way fucking more. esp in forearm and bicep. more chest striations.

general thoughts: super pogo month for development. didn’t do a lot of upper body bc my tricep was still injured for a good part but had lots of development even with this. also did abs this month which is nice. pog!</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/300399215_789821692366822_1681840887067309709_n_17985546886524810.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202208/300399215_789821692366822_1681840887067309709_n_17985546886524810.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202208/GH2f6hEz_jagcicCAKQify_dcctbkYLAAAF_17925697007367751" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/GH2f6hEz_jagcicCAKQify_dcctbkYLAAAF_17925697007367751"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdAGgAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17921351816465194" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdAGgAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17921351816465194"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/299990032_394725426076478_8793329899316958557_n_17853762596807276.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdAExBiTdLxqhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17849587193819276" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdAExBiTdLxqhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17849587193819276"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202208/fOxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17973938806670963" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/fOxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17973938806670963"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdAE5mZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17894479799668430" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdAE5mZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17894479799668430"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdADVP3ztkWhxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18312753802025991" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdADVP3ztkWhxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18312753802025991"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Aug 22, 2022, 1:18 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">physique update pogo! part 1
shirtless unflexed: gained two pounds pog! harder to eat more and def been plateauing on gaining weight but getting back to eating more. lowkey feel leaner bc waist is lowkey smaller, less hip dips. chest has&#064;more definition and forearms are bigger. 

front double bi flex: my right arm is still noticeable larger than left but right arm literally looks so unethical bigger than last month. just looks like some bodybuilder shit. lats grew so my waist looks even sluttier. v-shape going harder pog! chest kinda feels more defined and my forearm feels bigger.

straight arm left tricep flex: more shoulder stritations. tricep and bicep both look bigger. pog.

single arm chest flex: chest is looking a lot bigger. like a lot lowkey. other than that maybe arm is bigger but that’s all.

good for me. we ball. had an abs horrible leg day, felt like shit. honestly i realized i dislike a lot of people but there’s only one person i hate and that’s grace song. like i feel like i can rationally say what personality traits i dislike from others but not really from grace. it’s a more of a personal experience thing. and like thinking about her genuinely makes me so angry and like wanting to see her downfall. with like janine for example i honestly drc, like i’d prefer if she didn’t succeed but at the end of the day it’s not like i really desire it. but i really want to see grace fall and fail. it’s so bad idk. i saw ernie at the gym the other day and that shit genuinely pissed me off, he’s weak asf. okay maybe i’m hiding behind my ego from strength but idk. lowkey flexed on him. it’s so bad tho idk, hearing her name makes me so irrationally mad. bros actually living in my head rent free. i talked to my therapist about it and she was just like don’t blame yourself for feeling that way about grace, your emotions are irrational so don’t try to rationalize them and make it your fault. which is based asf and actually helped with my hatred of her. but yeah i really despise her. she’s also the only person i have muted bc seeing her stories make me so angry. also i think a primary factor of why i fall so fast for girls is that before i sleep i make fake scenarios with like faceless people and then when i’m slightly interested i make fake scenarios with them instead. bro it’s so bad how lonely i am. lowkey i feel like i’m gonna get a gf first semester but it’s lowkey bc we’re both lonely and we don’t like each other that much. okay don’t say that tbh i think i know myself a lot better and whether i fuck with people or not. i think i have 10days left in calgary holy fuck. gotta actually start packing wtf.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

a hour to make and i’m just bored. hit upper body today at the the gym and i was benching and i needed a spot and lowkey pogged off last set and pushed myself hard and my spotter was hyped, shit was honestly kinda hype cause he was hype which was pogo. i was thinking about this, but it’s turbo cringe that i’m not going to eng bc how tf am i gonna meet other twitch chatters in art. isn’t this the worst or what? also just called stephen today and it was pre pogo. we just banter in call and it was kinda nice. also tmmrw a really really old childhood/family friend is living in my house (i don’t even remember her 💀) and it’s not lit. she’s literally from fort mac and if you didn’t know i moved here in grade 3. so yeah. she’s also dating jonathon zhao. dunno if they doing long distance but ye. also on tuesday is lisa and subin’s bday party, and lowkey i’m bouta spend infinite again and i hate it. i hate spending money no kap. but it’s all g, tbh really just want these two to have a good time. i think bdays are just a special day for people so i lowkey want to make it that. but yeah we’re going for dinner and then having a campfire at lisa house. and high key it’s too fucking lit bc nick isn’t going to the campfire. it’s funny cause i told stephen and he was like “it’s lit” and then he told ethan and he said the same thing 💀. it’s just so much drama dodged, cause if subin and nick started beefing i’d just kms tbh. also lowkey wanna get subin drunk and farm the drama out of her. but yeah, lowkey down for this to be the last time we hang out like ever. ever since may the friend group honestly just sucked. it is what it is ig. honestly out of everyone i’ll prob miss talking to subin the most just cause ill hang out with everyone outside of the friend group alone except her. but i def can’t see myself hanging out with her alone. idk we will see ig. honestly prob will remember this summer as the summer i took shrooms. just the most notable thing that happened. maybe the summer i worked out. also i literally can’t control my emotions, everything feels so okay rn it’s weird. i think it’s more when some…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

kinda fucking nutty. honestly kinda crazy how much doing something daily really helps you. like taking shit one day at a time and being consistent is kinda pog. this might be the cope take that always happens in the beginning of the school year, but like if i do a hour of home work a day i’m honestly prob pogging. okay that honestly sounds like not a lot but we will see. i’m lowkey used to doing 0 min of school work and i might just default on that. on my sigma shit. this leg day all i did was watch tft on my phone, there was a tourney going on and k3soju (my fav streamer) streamed and he hasn’t streamed for like 2 weeks. i said this jokingly, but i think unironically my mental health has been worse when this guy wasn’t streaminf bc i had nothing to do. it’s insane how much i enjoy this guy streams. also was on leg press today like leg pressing 515 (btw no flex no ego but that’s with rom thats larger than 90% of the gym) and this guy came up to me and asked me how much i was pressing. he was like impressed and it was nice to have some random old guy be like damn but also im on the fucking leg press like idk. if i was squatting thag it would be a diff story. but that’s prob my first compliment at the gym so pog! felt pre good. the genuine biggest problem with my legs rn is that my glutes are really underdeveloped im pre sure. i do squats and my glutes hurt the most while my quads are chilling. also my legs hurt a lot rn. my back does too cause my rdl form was not the best today. on another note im pre sure i have one of the biggest legs of the gym, it’s really funny tbh bc i look at someone who is quite a bit larger than me, and then i look down and i see my legs are way huger. even tho my physique prob looks dumb i really like it, idk it’s just funny looking ig. said this last post but seeing that i’m actually jacked feels so good to me bc i’d go to the gym regardless of how i look. like it’s literally just a bonus i just like being at the gym, listening to music and trying my abs hardest. like i live to push myself harder bc i genuinely find it so rewarding. also i’ve realized</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

dry. mornings i get ready to go to the gym, afternoon i go to the gym and night i rest bc of the gym. it’s nice having all this time but it kinda sucks. tbh took a big L by not applying for a summer job, just could’ve filled my time more. i can’t believe i’m moving to uni so soon, i genuinely dk what i’m doing rn, i don’t even know what my room looks like or anything except my move in date. i just really don’t want to think about it or anything tbh. moving makes me really stressed. honestly glad i didn’t do jumpstart, it’s like 700 more but it makes me stressed seeing everyone move in early. idk what life i really want to live anymore, the more i think about what i want and the future the more anxious i get. honestly still rotting in my room, it’s not the best but whatever. also unrelated but my sister isn’t doing that well, the airline lost her luggage which is honestly one of the biggest Ls if you think about it and she’s stuck looking for a job so she has no money. my dad and sister called and i was eavesdropping and the call was def not pretty. i honestly feel pre bad for her and idk if there’s anything i can do to help. it’s also making me anxious seeing her like this just cause what if i end up like her after i graduate. she’s def someone i kinda look up to so seeing her like this makes me anxious. and school is making me anxious, feel like i’m gonna get shit on in arts cause i suck at english. also it makes me really sad that i don’t have any friends. like all the friend groups i’m in have just faded and i feel like i’m the problem. my therapist says it’s not but tbh i’m thinking about all the people i want to see before i leave and there’s not really anyone. i really hope i can have more friends. it’s been a long time since i went to bed feeling fulfilled with everything or safe. i think when that day comes i might cry tbh. everyday i have to remind myself to take it a day at a time but i wish i was just happy to be alive. like going to the gym, i’m just happy to be there and being jacked is honestly a bonus. i think about the future and i just wanna kms. and honestly</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

like a 11 year old so i am quite the shitter. also worked out with nick which was kinda mid, nothing to talk about tbh. he wanted me to get dinner with him and i actually refused cause i didn’t want to spend money. in my head i’m like why am i bouta spend $40 for us not to talk about anything. lowkey, sounds really dumb but this is one of the first times i’ve ever refused to do something with someone. and idk after felt really shitty but thinking about it it’s nice that i did i would’ve just felt bad if i spent more money. bro was insisting and i was like nah. honestly that’s pre good for me. feel like i have a really bad time refusing to hangout when i don’t want to. honestly money is stressing me tf out, i genuinely dk how finances will work in uni and i’m just so stressed about everything related to finances. idk just thinking about money makes me feel bad and not want to spend money. it’s genuinely giving me a lot of stress and i’m not doing anything about it. but like idk it’s bad ig. i just hate thinking about money. just so fucking stressful. also feel really high maintenance and shit. i hate money and it stresses me out. i had a decent amount of fun this summer and it was okay. not to suck this guys dick too hard or be like i’m dependent on this guy for happiness, but i was talking to my therapist about some of the best memories i had in the summer and they were all lowkey with howard. lowkey don’t tuck with anyone else. like talking to stephen. honestly a big part of me really wants to say fuck uni and just get some random job even tho ik i def want that.

fading away so i’m able to go to the gym more and it feels really good. i just really feel like myself at the gym, i get to actually really listen to music and just push myself really hard. and i just laugh at my own thoughts hysterically or talk to myself and i genuinely am so happy to be in the gym. and my ego is turbo boosted bc both ali and darsan said i was getting big when i saw them at the gym. lowkey didn’t say it back💀. i mean idk i don’t wanna lie and i’m kinda glad for ali cause he’s been injured for a long time so it would’ve been kinda obv im lying. idk going to the gym actually makes me really happy, like so much dopamine is just flowing thru my brain it’s fucking amazing. and these last couple of days i haven’t really been hanging out with anyone but i honestly don’t mind too much. feel like my life has just been at peace. idk prob jinxing shit hella but it’s all g. but honestly rn not feeling the best. lately been reminded of my bad trip, just random phrases or things just give me flashbacks. i remember thinking “being depressed has given me perspective on why i should live, so i should go insane and completely disassociate to fully understand if this is reality.” really braindead thought tbh. but i think lately i’ve been really scared things aren’t real. i think things being fake has always scared me, i remember when i was 6 thinking that i actually never woke up from my dream. i honestly try to counteract these thoughts by affirming that my emotions and experiences are real, therefore it doesn’t matter if things are real. that’s literally just “i think therefore i am” but yeah. it def makes me less anxious about reality being fake. writing these posts make me think about life too much, and honestly it might not be that healthy for me. i always think about how i don’t have a partner and how lonely i am. but honestly i’ve been living my life like “just don’t think about it” and it’s been kinda working. just taking things as they come has genuinely been working and i just try not to think about the future and my current state of life. like just living in the</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

these headphones are literally making me cum. so fucking good literally can’t hear anything else. but today was really good, had an amazing gym session where i was vibing and happy the entire time. literally just fucking dancing. and played rollercoaster tycoon which is like a 20 year old game but game is lowkey fun asf. gonna talk about music in this post, in no way do you have to listen to any songs but i was literally listening to these songs in the gym and legit like freaking tf out how good they are.
1.hydrocodone - black kray: song literally makes me cum, shit is so fucking unmixed and unpolished but it makes the song better. also prob my fav song oat. uses like 4 samples for its chorus and one of them is literally just this woman screaming and it’s so fucking good. like just hearing this woman scream in my ear gets me so hyped and massages the creases in my brain. 
2. pro: lov ad - sweet trip: i literally hear this song and start fucking stimming like idk shit just fucking hits. tbh shit is just a bunch of random ass sounds assembled together to make a song but shit goes so hard, i feel like when i hear random sounds my brain decides that the song is good. but the chorus is this woman singing and it’s so nice and just hearing such layered production with such unique sounds makes this song fuck.
3. this ski mask ain’t for COVID - ghais guevara: we got this mf going off and going off with this production. there’s this random ass instrument which sounds like a kazoo violin and shit is so fucking hype. and it’s just so in your fucking face, the lyrics, the delivery and the production. shit is just hard idk. like this production feels so fucking illegally good to me. was literally screaming in my head how good the production is.
4. bane - destroy lonely I FUCKING LOVE DESTROY LONELY. shit makes me feel swagged out and confident asf. lowkey a tiktok song. but shit is hard.
5. vanilla sky - bladee ecco2k: ecco just going off in this song, you don’t understand a single word that this mf is saying but you read his lyrics and you’re like damn. ecco also makes me feel real…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202208/298201115_180808847788999_6893784289244295323_n_17878240331718815.jpg"><img

fun and i feel like i improved a lot. just thinking about technique and shit idk just fun to improve. but since i’m a bitch going outside and doing work is so taxing on me mentally, makes me so tired. after we got pho and went to daniels house to teipsit them doing shroom. honestly should’ve just went home, just not feeling the vibes ig. idk by then i was just really tired and prob should’ve spent some alone time. it’s really cringe tho, i feel like when i’m out i kinda want to go home and start being really antisocial but when im at home i want to go out and get entertained. like genuinely there’s not a lot of times where im just living in the present. idk feels kinda bad. wish i can just be more satisfied with everything. after that my cousin came back from edmonton snd are staying for the night and leaving tmmrw. was lit to talk to my cousin one last time. and my aunt gave me more money (don’t wanna specify how much tbh) and i genuinely feel really bad about it. like idk why she’s giving me sm like i don’t really deserve it. it’s honestly too much. overall, feeling kinda bad rn, just feeling lonely ig. honestly excited to see my therapist tmmrw, it’s so bad how i can’t really function without seeing my therapist on a weekly basis. i feel like there’s genuinely just a lot to talk about. also cringe how i’m not over some stuff. i just want in uni for me to find people, hopefully a gf tbh. i feel like this inability to just tell completely everything to someone makes me feel like ass. like i genuinely dk how much longer i can do this for. i have never really felt completed as a person. just always missing something in my life. honestly, sometimes i go into my animal crossing world and i see these literal npcs so happy to talk to me and so happy to live in the world i made and idk. it’s so depressing how much it makes me feel happy. genuinely this animal crossing shit is such an escape from real life. it’s so fucked. it’s okay i will feel sigma bc im jacked and i do a skin care routine</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202208/FQIoAkMzLBdAJg9cKPXCjxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17935424048353506" controls="1" class="_a6_o

pretend i’m happy bc there’s people over. i actually fucking hate this sm. just can’t deal with this tbh. like genuinely can’t. also i’m smoking weed on my roof cause i feel like it and ig i’m coping. i’m reminded why i hate my dad sm, he’s been speaking more and i just get reminded of how big his ego is and how important masculinity is to him. it’s just so annoying when everything he does is based around that. it’s just something that pisses me off. also just the way we sightsee it so boring i’m just so incredibly bored. and i haven’t had a lot of alone time and i just feel so fucking grumpy forcing myself to socialize. it’s so awkward talking to my aunts and uncles cause my chinese is bad too. but some crazy shit is my cousin is in the exact same scenario as my sister, she’s bi and has told her mom but not her dad. she’s pre cool tbh, but we’ve run out of things to talk about. idk i also really hate myself rn just bc i’m in a negative mood. also i’m just a piece of shit. the stars are really pretty in the sky tho, these mf stars are better than any view i’ve see . it’s crazy how insignificant i am to the universe. idk i just really hate and loathe myself and more than ever i just want a gf who can comfort me in these moments. that feels so cringe to say but it’s really true, i hate saying i want a gf cause it makes me feel so desperate and incel. but it’s true and i can’t really deny that shit. speaking of, i honestly hate texting sm, i just hate replying to ppl. like gc are fine but i’m getting sick of all the girls i’m texting bc it’s just boring really. i think i’m just becoming more antisocial than ever. on an unrelated note i hear ppl just mention grace song and it actually kinda triggers me. idk ig i’m just not over it, im fine with angel but grace just fucks me up for no reason. it makes me feel really pathetic, how it’s been over a year and hearing her name makes me feel shitty. but everything makes me feel shitty, what else is new. like i realize i’m so sensitive to things, if the vibes are slightly off i just feel it so hard and kills my mood a lot. just in..</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

shit and i’m like no and i basically had to explain wtf a BA is. and i was like yeah idk might pivot into math or cs idk yet. and this guy started talking about how people my age have like a different mindset and there’s like a disconnect and i was like ???. so fucking confused. and lowkey pretentious idk bro. guy was lowkey annoying just cause he just said that shit so randomly and i’m like huh? bro just said he doesn’t fuck with me out of the blue and shit. idk. and then later he was like you wanna weld and i’m like bruh no. and he was like nah bro just invest in like $400 and you can weld at home and im like nah. and my cousin was lowkey tryna get him to leave cause it’s pre embarrassing and awkward and lowkey made things worse. idk generally, shits gonna be kinda ass cause i can’t walk around freely and i’m going have to entertain and think about the other ppl in the house and subconsciously i feel like i have to be a good asian child. but also i got paid $500 usd to do this so

the best specs bc i wanted something lightweight and relatively cheap. like lowkey, don’t want a gaming laptop bc 1. i have a switch 2. i don’t want a heavy laptop. like tbh having a light laptop actually makes a big diff to me bc it affects whether or not i actually take it out and use it or not. i find with heavy laptops i end up just never using it. plus i can use a pen on this bitch. idk shits honestly really nice lowkey taking it around everywhere. got my credit card today too, can’t wait to build my credit idk. just consumerism ig. and bought animal crossing. game is lowkey lit, just fun to play and not exciting but relaxing. hard to turn off the game too, i be playing and i’m like okay i’m down now and 3 hours later i’m still running around literally fishing. shit is too lit. prob gonna buy smash. nothing much more to say. lowkey feel like skipthedishes scammed me bc they made me pay 60 for the bags and 20 for a background check but it’s been like 7 business days and

emotionally but i feel like i’m going back on progress. honestly feel like i’m withdrawing a lot socially, every time i go out i just don’t really feel like it and every time i go home i just run into my room and lowkey rot in there. just feel so withdrawn from everything and emotionally not there. honestly feeling really financially stressed, other than high key regretting buying the switch, i just think about all the money in uni and all the money i’m going to need and just how i’m going to be in debt. and i lowkey don’t like going out cause i just really hate spending money, it kinda makes me feel really awful. i just don’t want to spend money. i just hate it. this is kinda funny but sometimes i think about just beating myself up until i’m all fucked up in the face and just inflicting pain upon myself from another version of myself. idk it’s like a dark fantasy but it’s funny. but fucked. honestly been wanting to kms a lot more, idk for some reason my mood just got entirely killed this summer and i just feel like ass. i feel so fucking lost tbh. like going out isn’t fun or staying at home. i’m just not having fun. and i feel so overwhelmed by going to uni tbh, idk just these finances. a big part of me just wants to say fuck it drop out so i don’t have to worry about debt. ik that’s a fucking int but idk. socially i’m pre scared to, if i don’t meet ppl i want to talk to ig ill just kms idk. idk i just really don’t see people wanting to talk to this mentally ill mf who doesn’t have his shit together. honestly i just don’t really see how people want to talk to me idk. maybe it’s cause i don’t feel confident rn, but i just find it so hard to believe that anybody is capable of loving. like so fucking unbelievably hard. sometimes i think about things i want to say to people that i’ve never said outloud bc im not close enough. and idk i feel so incomplete bc there’s no one to open up to. i just wanna be normal and happy. i’m so sick of being so

_a6-i">bro nothing to fucking write about lowkey. but this is summer is kinda lit my entire day is built around me going to the gym. i sleep from 12-9, lie in bed till like 11, eat breakfast, leave for gym at 12, workout till 3 and then be too tired to do anything and do the same thing the next day. it’s honestly too fucking lit. todays leg day was exhausting, i went thru every single emotion there was in like 3 hours. but it was fucking sick, i had an rpe 10 squat today (basically just a really hard squat that took me like 5 sec to do) and just generally pushed myself really hard. during one of my sets i checked my phone and i saw that sarah left me on seen for like a hour. i then started full fucking griefing bc i was like bro this girl does not fuck with me at all. and then after like 15 min she responded and i was like bruh i just overreacted idk. shit was bad tho. my therapist said something based tho, she’s like yeah this girl is gonna push you outside your comfort zone and you just gotta go thru it to gain more confidence with yourself. and i was like that’s true idk she said it way better. i just thought of it more as like bro i’m just depressed asf and i still haven’t healed fully bc the feelings of unworthiness comes up. also she said i was based bc i actually let who i am show and be vulnerable. what can i say i’m just based. okay idk. but generally had a good therapy session, shit was based and i liked talking about it. got to bitch about nick too. idk this nick guy told subin while he was drunk that they would be perfect together and i’m like bruh you said that after you liked lisa her bsf and nick and subin have sm history. like it’s just the pot being stirred yet again. just cringe. like a party with of some of the biggest nerds i’ve ever seen was a million times more fun then any of my friend group parties.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

to and we just did random shit and shit was turbo fucking fun. and then i threw up cause i took three shots in the row and basically sobered up after that and the vibes were lower. when i’m drunk also sometimes i just feel all these overwhelming feelings of how desparate i am and it makes me feel like ass. but after i threw up me howard and ben walked to ben’s house and lowkey it was really nice. i want to get close to ben again. and during that i talked to howard one on one and i genuinely really enjoyed that convo idk. it was just nice talking about shit and opening up. after that i talked to ella about nerdge shit and music, lowkey i was vibing to music during the time but i listened to some of the shit she recommended me and i was like some of this fucking blows. bruh moment. but idk it was nice, we had a pre good debate over neopronouns and talked about media and shit. idk was kinda nice. but after that convo i got so tired and just stayed awake for 2 hours not really enjoying my time too much. ryan and daniel got super wasted by themselves and they drank way too much and it def wasn’t a vibe. after i ended up driving home at 4, and i don’t regret it i love sleeping in my own bed. abs love it. but honestly after i drink i just get a rush of how fucking desperate i am for human connection. and how lonely i am. i’m just never really able to shake off that feeling, like i had a good heart to heart with howard but i actually need a girl. which is fucking cringe tbh. but idk it’s just a lot ig. but overall i had fun, im really glad george enjoyed his time too. max and darsan were high key being annoying and i was kinda pissed. but it was fun.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">2nd slide literally me at the gym today. yesterday i said the world is mine is lowkey shit and today that fucking manga gave me a literal existential crisis. idk just having a fucking identity crisis and lowkey lost feelings for this sarah girl so maybe that contributed but idk prob not a lot. realized sometimes i just don’t act normal to affirm myself and i was like bruh wtf. it’s like i don’t have a single connection or relationship that makes me feel real or affirmed, so i just reject humanity and try to be as much as an outcast as i can to try to feel real. it’s like i’m down to fucking end it no kap. jk but idk today was just a fucking ass day, legit was just fucking contemplating life for the entire day. idk man, gym was so hard today but i’m glad i did it. i also affirm myself with pain, it makes me actually feel fucking real. also ig i fucked up by telling sarah that i really like depraved or depressed media bc being able to find meaning even tho you’re deeply aware of how dogshit humanity is. like honestly, that wasn’t even self destructive me to say. that’s just a good take imo. but idk she lowkey ghosted me after that and i’m like bruh this is fucking cringe no? generally tho, any form of rejection just adds to the feelings of feeling unloveable, i mean idk tbh wasn’t that interested in her. she’s cool to talk to but def nothing i could prob vibe with hard. down to meet people irl and organically. generally the same theme persists where idk if i can say i love anyone. actually tho, howard the fucking goat. idk if i said this on the spam, but this guy lowkey “saved” (cringe word to use idk) my life like twice. post-attempt this guy hung out with me a lot which was honestly really good for coping and when i had my bad trip this guy was there and made sure i didn’t do any fucked shit (which i’m pre sure i would do if he wasn’t there). he def doesn’t feel like a big deal, and bc he didn’t literally do something to save my life it doesn’t feel like a big deal, but idk it’s nice knowing i have him. yeah thanks howard. bro is goated with the sauce. thinking about that made me feel better tbh.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

so didn’t press today, but had an upper body day for the first time in forever. high key feel so confident in a wife beater i can’t even lie. idk i’m just lowkey big asf. i’ve been talking to this sarah girl a decent amount and i’m slowly losing interest. idk our text aren’t too interesting and she’s cool but idk. feel like it’s hard to meet ppl over text and not irl. bc our conversation take place in such long periods. she’s pre cool tho, lowkey she’s motivating me to read bc she is a big reader and i’m lowkey simping. it’s cringe ik. idk i’ve been wanting to read so ig if it motivates me. finished the world is mine which is a manga and it’s just weird asf. that’s all there it is to it. honestly lowkey i’m still kinda simping can’t lie. she’s just nice to talk to idk. but idk i feel like ill inevitably feel disappointed and end up not liking her. i asked her to hang out when we both move in to campus and she was down so ig that’s a good sign? idk tbh idk how i feel about her, as you guys knows my feelings when it comes to first meeting a girl is too fucking erratic. but lowkey i feel like once i start getting to know her ill actually connect with her. actually i’m prob baiting myself hard but her two fav books are a little life and the trial so surely she’s based. i mean idk, the way she talks about things i feel like she has a lot of confidence about herself or insightful about life. bro why tf am i talking sm about this girl i’ve barely met. i’m too cringe no? bro is actually too fucking desperate it’s kinda sad. high key i’m fucking down to say nothing is gonna happen and call it. down to be friends with her. okay maybe not. okay she def seems more complex than lisa and kaitlyn. okay just prayge idk.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

lowkey. just really nice to catch up with them and ig it’s one of the only friends i’ve been friends with throughout hs. which is really nice tbh. good to talk to them all again really missed them. can’t wait to talk to nimai too, haven’t talked to him in a long time. really cringe how i sleep at 9, when the clock hit 9 i was so fucking exhausted in front of everyone and idk i wish i had more energy. but lowkey this sleep schedule is nice. hung out with lisa too and honestly convo with her isn’t bad, i wouldn’t say entertaining but it’s honestly not horrible. lowkey talked shit about nick the entire time and felt like i could finally unload all the things i was bottling up about him. idk he’s just cringe and there’s been a lot of things annoying me. i’ve started talking to this girl that’s going to ubc that i found on the ubc 2026 page (cringe right?) and our convo is honestly going pre well. she’s pre cute but honestly what made me dm her was that she liked calvin and hobbes and her music taste was based. and i was like i gotta know this woman. and generally she’s giving me like reverse icks, she will use cute text emoticons like :o, her fav novels are incredibly based and generally she seems like someone i’d enjoy talking to. i don’t have feelings for her rn but ill see how things go, lowkey feel bad for ghosting her the entire day but it’s fine. i mean idk, im just a big ghoster nowadays i don’t really like texting back fast. i def really want to get to know her better, hopefully we will be good friends at least.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

much to say today. just one thing i wanted to add from yesterday trip rant was i was really conscious of consent even tho i as literally delusional. idk man kinda makes me question mfs that say they

lying in bed. unfortunately tho, i injured my tricep gonna see a physio today. just hitting legs now. legs getting strong too. it feels so good when i unrack for a squat and i can see the bar bend on my back. today i woke up and i honestly had some fucked up dresms and shit made me suicidal all morning. crazy how my mood affects my thoughts so much, i be like what’s the point of living another week. i dreamed about kissing this girl i used to barely know, don’t think i’ve ever talked to her. and i chose her out of a group of girls i can’t remember. and then i was making out with her and i just remember thinking “am i going to do this just so i can pretend not to feel lonely.” and i remember cuddling with her and just feeling fucking empty as fuck. idk weird fucking dream. and then after my gf turned into ploo and she couldn’t sleep until 3am and i was upset cause she was busy streaming. dreams are fucking crazy. but waking up from that just made me so fucking lonely dawg. even my subconscious know that i don’t wanna hook up with any mfs. i think my dream was tryna be a wet dream but i think i legit got too fucking depressed that i didn’t get hard in my dream and i ended up cuddling 💀. like bro. idk man dream just felt too real, except for the part of me getting bitches. i think i was lowkey in a haram. idk sometimes i think about words a girl could tell that would make ne cry if i heard them. shit i almost cried on the train thinking about some phrases. dawg is too lonely. but i got busy with work and now i’m chilling. i’m home alone for this weekend, won’t do much other than sleep at 9:30. but idk might do shrooms. lowkey idk if i want to bc i’m scared to trip by myself. and a little bit i’m scared what i’m going to find out about myself. idk, just scared ima learn i’m a piece of shit and then wanna kms for 4 months again. there’s a lot of thoughts i haven’t wrote down this week just bc i’m too tired to, but here are a couple today. idk i’m such a fucking

days ago but it couldn’t post prob bc i posted a video about how to make tnt (in mc ofc 🥸). honestly work is a lot of fun and i really enjoy being a team lead, it brings me a lot of pleasure knowing people trust me as there team lead and respect me. my therapist was high key like i told you so, you have a lot of traits that make you a strong leader and ik working would give you a purpose. and she’s right tbh, idk i feel like the best part about work is just being a leader. shit just is nice. talked to howard the other day and it’s crazy how things have changed. i remember i used to drag this guy out to hangout every week and he would be introverted and want to stay inside. now it’s the complete opposite, swear this guy is going out a lot while i’m just sitting at home grinding tft. it was nice talking to him tho, it’s been a long time and i feel like our conversations are never really stale no matter how long the time. really exhausted from work nowadays, can basically nap on command and when i’m working i’m fighting off sleep. that’s what happens when i’m forced to wake up at 5::30. but i’m still able to find the motivation to go to the gym which is really good. might’ve injured my left tricep which honestly feels really bad, been having a lot of setbacks at the gym and generally haven’t progressed in a long time bc of situations that force me to be inconsistent. it’s fine hopefully it resolves itself by tmmrw. been sleeping super early, pre sure i slept at 10 yesterday. work has been giving me a lot of purpose and life hasn’t been too bad</div><div class="_3-95

agriculture centre and shit is lowkey kinda lit. i do gotta help out with cleaning once in a while, but lowkey my only responsibility is running random tasks and making sure everyone is working. today was lowkey a turbo int, just cause stampede didn’t start yet so there was legit no guest so we were just cleaning shit over and over again. i had to tell a bunch of kids to pretend to work cause i’m not down to get in trouble no kap. today shift was also bad bc my legs were super sore from leg day, also bro hasn’t worked a day in his life so my feet lowkey cramped. the other team leads are cool, there’s this guy named tyler who i’m pre sure is autistic but honestly he’s a pre friendly guy and making convo is kinda hard but it’s kinda enjoyable. nayeesh is basically my partner and she’s super nice and teaching me the ropes. this other team lead prob hates me bc i’m hella clueless and i wasn’t using gloves or mask for this disinfectant, she lowkey flamed me cause she’s like bro this a chemical shits serious, but there’s no whmis symbols of irritant or corrosive and the two bosses handle that shit without protection. there’s this other girl who seems to kinda young who’s kinda cute, but her teeth are kinda fucked and i realized that teeth actually mattered 💀. hella mean thought but idk she seems nice. one of the bosses is erin and he’s prob a hard conservative from the vibes (commented on how covid is a scare tactic) but like tbh idrc and he’s pre friendly. and the main boss is blayne and he’s this old mf and he’s pre chill and shit. the bosses are pre laid back. honestly acting really friendly and shit, really out of character of me but it’s honestly kinda nice to act friendly. maybe i should act friendlier out of work but that’s a lot of effort. saw this guy named connell which is one of howard friends, strange meeting him there. i have no clue how i’m a fucking team lead, but i feel like i’m doing a fine job. got 10 more days of this, see how this shit goes.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202207/292520489_368683638730699_6671855940919549599_n_17924255111322497.jpg"><img

pog. feel pre big. lowkey i be in the gym and the way i motivate myself is “bro make sure everyone around you knows you are mentally insane and been to a psych ward.” that shit hypes me up cause it makes me not care what others around me think (cause i want them to think i’m insane) and it actually makes ne push myself really hard bc i don’t want to look like a sane person who pussies out when there is pain. this is the most braindead shit ive ever said but it works. like i just try to be as unhinged as possible in the gym and it makes my gym session really enjoyable. been really tired lately, just don’t have energy for the gym and doing random shit. feels kinda fucking shit. starting work on two days, finna kms lowkey but ill just grind make money and then wanna die after. this is a cringe thought but lately been feeling like i’m too stoic when it comes to certain things. it’s depressing asf how i have history with half the people ik, pre depressing that i didn’t get invited to a party bc too many ppl hate me. but like high key shit doesn’t affect me that much. and i feel like i should. idk if it’s i’m just so emotionally withdrawn to everything or if i’m actually emotionally secure with myself and moved on. like genuinely, i feel like there’s a lot of things are comments that should affect me more or would’ve but idk i’m just so unaffected by it. feels kinda weird. and bad bc maybe i have a victim complex. ig it feels bad bc idrc about anything so i’m just withdrawn and don’t feel like a human. like highkey i don’t get fomo. idk. it’s depressing i don’t get sad about things, idek why. maybe it’s just cause ik i won’t have that good of a time tbh. idk. wish i cared about things more</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

like eva but talks about different themes. so many parallels. anyways it’s actually pre good, artwork highkey carried, lowkey what kept me reading was just the gore and the fucked up imagery and

i’ll think about things and ill forgot what i want to write about at the end of the day. that being said, i really don’t hold back on this spam, kinda weird how i just run an account where 17 of my old friends just hear some of my most mentally ill thoughts and deepest thoughts in my psyche. it’s crazy how i’m honestly able to be so honest on here. it’s prob unhealthy asf dissecting my psyche every single night. i prob do a lot of it cause i don’t think i’m a good person and feel like i constantly need to reevaluate who i am. anyways, this is a cringe thought but, ik i always joke about how a girl never gets to see how jacked i am but lowkey it’s kinda true. like i appreciate everyone who encourages me in my fitness journey (cringe way of saying it) but like i actually wish there was a girl who uhh appreciated it in other ways. and like it’s not even cause i be horny and shit, maybe it’s my lonely subconscious. yeah lowkey i think i just want someone that’s proud of me with something i’m so proud about myself with. and that’s not to say your encouragement is not enough, it’s just prob the bigger issue of how i’m feeling chronically lonely. cringe ig. now i wish the reason was cause i’m just horny. anyways, cringe asf that my parents came home from europe and brought covid, kinda like salt to the wounds. all of this ain’t even there fault, i just wish i had a good relationship with my parents (which i choose and never will which is not there fault). also this nick guy is pulling hella girls, including lisa cause they were cuddling and shit at the party yesterday. don’t really give af too badly, but it’s annoying how he does it to lowkey stroke his ego, just joking about how i don’t pull. like idgaf but also i see the underlying motivation and think it’s super cringe. ego tbh is not hurt too much tho. but lowkey got me thinking about how i’m really bored and don’t have anyone to talk to and ig i wish i actually pulled. ik i would probably hate talking to these girls but it’s also me like half coping. don’t have anything to fall back on in life. just need my new beginning</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

a child, idk it’s just nice cause it’s innocent. a lot of too i feel like is bc i didn’t really get to experience that so it’s nice to see characters that are innocent. moreover, it’s nice to see

cringe and i lowkey feel sick. went to gym today and felt like shit and just went home instead. have done 3 covid test but lowkey had a headache the entire day. feel like i have covid.

the friend group drama legit never ends. we all hung out two days ago and lowkey i thought it was gonna blow up but one of the main instigators didn’t show up so thank god. basically at my “bday party” nick was alone the entire time bc im pre sure he wants to ghost everyone. like he lowkey made the pizzas by himself. (i think a lot of us tried to help but to not avail). after that he literally was physically separated from the group the entire time, which was hella cringe and a mood kill. so highkey i went to smoke with him just to make sure he’s okay and he was and he just told me shit and i was like damn. once we came back he was sitting on the couch and i tried to get him off bc the group wanted to use the couch and he told everyone that i forced him to go to them, when in reality i told him he could go to my room bc i wanted to use the couch. that hella tilted me. anyways this just shit i’m pissed at nick about. eventually, subin tried to talk to him and he told her to “go away cause he wanted to be alone.” and he eventually left without anyone noticing. but then after, subin and lisa are talking alone and we all know that subin is prob ranting about nick. so according to lisa, subin is mad at nick bc she was only texting lisa during the night and not talking to her. and lowkey after i got subin perspective, it’s kinda fair that she’s pissed when nick is apparently being really unresponsive to her over text but lisa isn’t. and nick lowkey wants to leave the friend group and i feel like he lowkey has feelings for lisa. from what i hear, nick talks a lot to lisa and idk if lisa reciprocates. cause apparently, lisa is always dodging the question on whether or not to hang out with him alone or not. and i feel like subin and nick are just going to blow up too. and i’m still lowkey pissed at him for killing the mood on my party, he could’ve just not came. also, nick told me that

frontal not flex: look the same, more shoulder definition and arm definition, lowkey lost abs. 

double bicep flex: lats are a lot bigger, triceps and biceps lowkey bigger. just more intimidating 

single arm flex: shoulder definition way more and shoulder volume way more. tricep volume more too

chest flex: chest looking slightly bigger, main difference is the arm growth tbh</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">didn’t do anything today except play hoi4. actually no lifing the most nerdge game, and procrastinated applying for a job again. mainly wanna talk about yesterday. went to the gym and saw darsan’s entire friend group there. they were being typical hs and trying to max out there bench with 8 ppl at one bench. but idk came over and spotted them and tried to help them. and i helped them squat and taught them how to deadlift too. and idk was kinda enjoyable, i really do want to get ppl into to the gym and teach them bc it genuinely gives me a lot of joy. and it’s not once in a while to try and help ppl during my workouts. but also worked out insanely hard yesterday. legs were genuinely so dead. they invited me to this church’s bbq after and idk it felt so fucking random. like i was just at this church and these guys were preaching to me and shit. idk lowkey shit on church too much, if it helps ppl open up and create a sense of community it’s not too bad. but the entire time they were talking i was like how tf am i here. also talked to this grade 11 named victoria who i literally see everywhere, she told me her fav book was no longer human which is so fucking based and a turn on, i ask for her music taste and she says j cole and russ and that shit gave me the ick. after that she could tell i was hard judging her and lowkey i just started trolling, idk maybe it’s self destructive bc i troll so i can reject someone first before they can but it’s also really fun just roasting ppl and lowkey being myself and saying dumb shit. i asked for her number in this really dumb way and it was pre funny. but after me literally being at church, i went with ice cream with darsan’s friends and shit was alr. it was a good time talking to them but when we were all sitting at a bench some random drunk 40 year old came up to us (he looks well off) and started talking to us. i genuinely felt pre uncomfortable and everyone was and that i was just fulfilling some npcs convo. guy was lowkey aggressive, like he said to one of my friends  ill kill you (he’s being lowkey sarcastic but he’s also a random drunk on the street), he said money doesn’t mean shit but winning stanley cup does..</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202206/GKp3PRGVY1dIlXwAALx9Ns7oCHRgbkYLAAAF_18302515945005388" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">4. my parents came back. which is good ig, that means less chores and more no lifeing. they bought me a lot of gifts which is nice. haha but they still missed my bday! ik i wouldn’t really want to celebrate my bday with them anyways but idk. makes me fucking depressed that that’s the state of our relationship rn. just saw a tiktok of a happy couple while taking a break writing this post. brb gonna beat my dick to cope. anyways yeah, that feels really bad. wish things were better but ig it will never be. ig ill talk about my friend group. on wednesday it was like technically my bday. and shit was not hyped. lowkey i only really got drunk which is honestly really cringe, if ik not many ppl were drinking i wouldn’t have bought so much alc and wouldn’t have gotten drunk. the only other pre drunk person was nick but this guy was highkey just isolating himself the entire night. like we would do something as a group and he would sit by himself and sure he can do that but it’s also really cringe and a mood killer. like i checked on him to make sure he was okay and we were gone for like 30 min smoking but idk. and like i get why he wants to be alone and shit and i was literally trying my best to accommodate him but he lowkey flamed me which was really cringe bc why am i even accommodating him. like if he didn’t really want to hang out he could’ve just stayed home tbh. idk just such a mood kill and it’s annoying that he lowkey disrespected me when im trying to accommodate him. generally tho, the rest of the friend group was boring asf bc we had nothing to talk about and nothing to do. so i was honestly trying my best to make sure everyone was having fun and it felt like ass tbh. im not really a friend group person too. so lowkey i was trying to accommodate everyone and they did a lot of things for me and im really appreciative but that night was just a shit show and im lowkey down to ghost my entire friend group. idk things just kind of suck with the group rn and there’s a lot of just random shitty drama and tension and i just want the group to go back to what it was. but tbh ik this wouldn’t last. after that day i literally had $4 in my bank account and lowkey -7 friends</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202206/288501833_136727742310649_7662458375311944679_n_17945062406034174.jpg"><img

_a6-i">had the time of my life at the concert. moshed so fucking hard. met this guy named ahmed and he was pre cool but lowkey he didn’t follow me back on insta and i’m kind of touched. but the mosh pit is insane, i actually don’t think i’ll ever go to a concert with this typa energy even tho this is my first concert. btw, the stars aligned for this concert, 18+ concert 8 days after my bday, fav artist is coming to calgary and only happened bc he had to cancel his show before. idk i’m just so fucking happy. stayed in the mosh pit and shit insane, they’re were literally some points where mfs were pressed against both sides of me that it made it hard to breath. like i got squished lowkey hella. and there was just mad pushing around and jumping and shit was so hype. unmatch energy. and like i’ve seen so many ig stories of peggy concert and like genuinely this guy is kind of my idol, just seeing him irl seemed so surreal bc im so used to seeing this guy behind the screen. it was almost like a “this guy is actually real” moment for me. like i was there and i realized that he was a real person who actually made my songs and that i actually look up to. and idk. shit was so fucking fun. i’m genuinely very happy. but honestly after, i actually was so fucking depressed, i won’t get into it now but yesterday was lowkey a shit show. nothing happened but the mood was just so shit and lowkey i was just drunk by myself and it was genuinely not fun. not to be dramatic, but my friends lowkey ruined msi and this concert. walking home today i was just sad as shit cause last night just weighing on me. idk today is so crushing without the concert. i just want to ghost everyone and actually no life this summer. going out is such a chore lowkey. i’m honestly prob gonna be sober and not smoke this entire summer, just cause it’s not fun to drink with my friends and being drunk isn’t fun without the right mood. which puts $50 of alc to waste. i’m so exhausted lowkey. thank you guys on the spam that are still here. and reading. idk why i said it just wanted to say it.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

(this gon be cringe) but i finally remade my resume and applied for jobs after 2 months of procrastinating! pog! woke up at like literally 12 today shit was pog. tbh not that sad about sarah, i alr lowkey got the message wednesday but it’s good that i heard it explicitly. wish i got closer with her tho. she basically just said she’s emotionally unavailable for any friendships. unlucky ig :/. might be the biggest copium take but, i’m down to incel this summer and not talk to any woman or open up at all. i just want that new beginning and shit in ubc and i don’t really feel like developing my current relationships. but maybe at ubc ill be single again for a long time 😃. how pog is that. last night i went off on the account tho, bro was like malding about getting no girls. shiba. but now that school doesn’t exist, im hella fucking lonely everyday. like idk, i just wanna talk to  somebody ig. actually it’s more like the forced interactions with random people is kinda nice. dawg i wanna cry. just realizing that the only girl that actually made me feel comfortable (highkey i was just baiting myself with lisa and kaitlyn) would want to talk to me but just can’t :/. like shiba. idk. dawg actually cried real tears about that shit on my bday can’t lie. 2 hour conversation made me cry that most i’ve had in 6 months. i’m different. not in a good way tho. in a “i shouldn’t be a

money but enjoyed my time. shit was fun with nick. and i just got really drunk. actually all drunk ppl say that, i can walk in a straight line but i’m like 6 shots away from passing out imo. idk had a really good time. lowkey the best part was biking home from the train station alone, was just really drunk and just screaming lyrics. almost fell off my bike because the grass was bumpy but was able to recover. idk just felt so fucking fun singing lyrics outloud at 1 am. can’t lie tho, im home now and i’m abs feeling like ass. well not completely but being home reminds me of the shit in my life. idk just reminded that now i don’t go to school i have 0 interactions with anyone. and i have to get a job. idk. shit makes me super depressed can’t lie. like thinking about it maybe i was horny enough to bring a girl home but also idk if i actually wanna participate in hookup culture. like idk shit prob make me depressed asf and like i honestly wouldn’t be comfortable hooking up with a complete stranger. which is lowkey a good thing, cause i went clubbing and bar hppping with the intention to have fun and not hookup. which made it better. but idk, im actually so fucking lonely. smoked so much today too cause i was drunk. but everyday i’m reminded how fucking lonely i am. the thing is i feel like nobody is good enough to relieve that. except sarah which is fucked. idk just from that convo we had wednesday i actually felt like she was too good for me (in terms of like emotional maturity and other things) and just felt heard and actually felt like opening up. that’s why i cried after tbh, feels like after all feeling like nobody hearing me i found someone and she doesn’t really want to talk to me as much as i want to tslk to her. genuinely don’t wanna date her tbh, but idk. she’s like the only person i don’t feel good enough to tslk to, bc i actually feel comfortable opening up. and idk i say this about every girl ig. but it’s different bc it’s not even romantic feelings i have. i just want to talk to her. ig ill&#064;just drunk text her or smth. bc that’s the only time i have balls to tell…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

sarah yesterday (girl i used to sneak out with) and lowkey it was really nice. idk she just reassures me a lot and it’s nice talking to her. realized the other ppl i talk to don’t really make me feel like myself compared to her. but lowkey that shit made me feel like ass cause she has her own things she’s dealing with and i kinda realized we prob won’t be that close or talk that much. and when i got home i actually felt like complete fucking ass. which makes me feel like a bitch bc i just went to got coffee with a girl and she’s alr made me feel horrible :/. like i didn’t cry a lot, but i cried a lot more than i have for a long time. idk it’s prob just bc it’s one of the first times i’ve felt really comfortable talking to someone and i haven’t genuinely felt like that in a year. and then realizing that feeling is fading just made me feel like ass. just realized how lonely i really am. even tho i wouldn’t want to celebrate with my parents anyways, it makes me feel like ass knowing i’m so distant with my parents that they’re not even in calgary. after realizing how lonely i am it made me feel ass that there was no celebration for my bday. but lowkey i’m just being a baby. but than i just went for a smoke and than bought some alc. and then i called subin and i just started drinking and i trauma dumped to another female! genuinely tho, it’s nice just trauma dumping ig, listening to others problems but idk i can’t help but think i’m just trauma dumping. but it’s genuinely one of the only times where i talk about my past or things that have happened. and it’s nice opening up in that moment. i went to school today and i’ve just been thinking that i really need this new beginning. i need things to be new again. and new ppl. i’m honestly really not excited for this summer bc idk wtf i’m going to do all day. life is genuinely very boring. i need to get a job. but i just hanging on to going to ubc. idk i just need that new beginning and hopefully find ppl i actually want to talk to. bc finding ppl rn is so useless, that friendship won’t even last.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">feel like i haven’t made a spam post in a long time. living home alone is a big difference than living with my parents. i actually go around the house doing things and generally doors are open making things feel less claustrophobic. i’ve been listening to a lot of classical music lately and have been genuinely enjoying it. and i’m trying to learn the piano by myself. bc idk i listen to some piano sonata and it kinda makes me sad that i can’t play the song and i want to for some reason. but also i get frustrated pretty easily too. i honestly have been enjoying walking my dog, it’s good time to listen to listen to new music but it’s also just genuinely fun, which makes me think i’ve had a lot of character development bc i used to hate walking my dog cause i just think about depressing shit. it’s good that i’m able to sit with my own thoughts now without feeling abs ass and being in the moment. i also made a mean philly cheese steak yesterday. bday coming up and i’m not that excited tbh. idk just don’t really feel like making plans and all of that. but i’m really enjoying the flow of life rn, maybe no crazy shit is happening but it’s okay rn. it’s pretty stable ig. which is good. but thinking back at my days they are fun and pretty content but again, i don’t really feel like i’m connecting with others. i get to chill with my dog and everything but tho i like what i have rn, i don’t want this to be the life i live. but it’s not too bad, life can just be more than what it is rn. honestly, maybe it’s the social media validation but i’ve been feeling a lot more confident lately, maybe too confident. idk i look at my post or i’ll look at myself with a pump and my shirt off, and i genuinely feel very attractive and lowkey im like “damn, there’s no way i don’t have a gf.” or “it’s such a shame no one is dating me” maybe that’s egotistical asf but idk, it’s nice feeling like im actually attractive. maybe it’s also the gym making me feel confident (also my cheekbones are sharper ever since i’ve went to the gym). but the other side of it is wow im so attractive but i get no girls bc my personality is shit and i have no game 😔.</div><div class="_3-95

just means you’re doing it for yourself and for your own entertaining. and i feel like it’s the most respectable motivation to do something. but by being this egotistical about my motivation, im 1. kinda being an asshole 2. clearly i’m lowkey not doing it cause it’s fun but it gives me a superiority complex over others. like tbh, it feels so good to have someone stress and resent something that they feel they have to do bc of self-worth or pressure and then you do it bc it’s fun 🗿. idk it’s also mainly cause it was fucking with this girls head so much that i said i was doing math for fun. it’s just funny to see ppl have to contemplate things they can’t imagine. and just be an anomaly in that moment. anyways starting tmmrw i’m going to be home alone. idk wtf i’m gonna do. but yay ig! but it’ll be okay. coping out of my mind tho bc im gonna be alone on my bday. have a mf test that day. but i will be with toro. here are some random toro habits: 1. every time i come home he gets so excited he has to bite something (usually a slipper) but he lowkey does it bc it’s his way of leveraging me to cuddle with him bc i have to go up to him and ask him to drop it but he will only drop it if i tell him he’s a good boy and pet him. he does this by taking the shoe away from me so i have to chase him but today i wasn’t fast enough so he came back to make sure that i saw him biting the shoe. 2. this guy lowkey knows when we’re talking about him and he gets embarrassed. 3. every time i sit on the couch he will jump up on the couch bc he knows it’s time to cuddle 4. every time i leave my room he will boop the door to see if i fully closed the door bc he wants to go in and see if there’s food he can steal 5. this guy sometimes randomly barks when i leave my room bc he hears me and thinks i’m an intruder 6. he will put his head between your thighs to force you to cuddle with him 7. he’s a big peoples pleaser</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

anymore bc of drama. cringe. got a lot of complements for my fit, genuinely made me really happy. lowkey they were all guys and a couple of girls but whatever. im glad people liked my fit. idk. last night was such a mess. yk it was a mess when the best thing that happened last night was i that i got rejected by kaitlyn. bc after that, me being drunk asf i was super honest and we both just started venting about our lives. and it was genuinely nice. i felt like i actually was talking to her. and that hour conversation felt so fast and it was such a nice convo, i really hope she likes talking to me as much as i like talking to her. i honestly still like her a bit but it’s kind of fading. and tbh, the way she talks about things is similar to the way i approach things. and lowkey it’s unfortunate that she doesn’t like me back bc i feel like it would go well :/. but emotionally i don’t really have feelings bc she’s not making anything romantic, which makes me just want to be friends with her. or maybe i’m coping out of my mind. but idk, im happy i got to know kaitlyn. and that i called her that night. time for the real tea.

this story requires a lot of context that i’ve talked about, so it might be a little confusing for non-regular readers. the night of the banquet went really well tbh, and we all planned to drink the day after. so we all start drinking and lowkey, thomas is pissing me off (it’s also his first time drinking). generally, his attention seeking habits become more prevalent and it’s annoying asf. this ends up leading him to take 6-8 shots in a row, while we’re all telling him to stop and we physically took away the alc away from him. after the shots hit, he projectile vomits on my arm and my phone and i’m fucking pissed. i end up cleaning his mess bc i alr got vomit on me. and i tell him to fucking lie down on his side and rest cause this guy has had too much to drink and i’m lowkey yelling at him. this isn’t even the worst part of the night, im just saying this bc im genuinely so angry. bc this mf, didn’t apologize for anything, didn’t thank anyone for taking care…</div><div class="_3-95

ree’s, which is ironic cause i flamed her for becoming valedictorian but it was the only good speech. we got some random alumni “test pilot” guy to do a speech and it genuinely was shit. there was a speech before him to jack him off and his accomplishments and his speech was generally really unfocused and the anecdotes were pretty forgettable and unrelated. anyways from the 4 hours sitting down so many thoughts were brewing, mainly negative and i lowkey wanted to kms. just thinking back at my hs experience i really can’t wait to leave. and even tho my friend group is highkey dysfunctional, it’s nice having them. they’re is a lot of problems but it’s not too bad. also i just hate the ceremony so much, just doesn’t really feel like it’s done for me persay and more done for the parents, the staff and the tradition. i mean idk ig it’s something you have to do but i just think it’s cringe. the people giving speeches don’t really represent us at all and if anything i feel more disconnected from my community. and it annoys that all the student speakers are mfs that are 4 club execs and sc members. just doesn’t really represent the avg population imo. and it just further establishes the pretentiousness of the ceremony. generally tho, i just hate peoples or things that demand my respect bc of their position. also i’m just a very cynical person, everything i see always has its flaws. i say that tho, but it my cynicism honestly serves me most of the time. it’s not like i get sad from hating. and i see the flaws in people and don’t talk to them. so it’s kinda hard to let go. also i’m just really vain. ego sometimes is fucking huge. but i’m not one to flaunt i just feel like i have to prove myself as better in someway without flaunting. pretty cringe. honestly feel like i do it bc i don’t have a support system that makes me feel okay with who i am, but it’s not like it’s gonna go away once i have one. talking to my friends was fun tho. home alone for two days. excited ig? also not talking to my therapist literally makes me wanna die. too dependent on weekly therapy appointments</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

major, took a 3 hr nap and that was basically the day. in the last year improving a lot mentally if i’m being honest. when i’m sad posting nowadays i’m seeing things more clearly, often i’m like yeah this feels so fucking ass but i have a couple of things that make me happy. or i’m like yeah it’s okay if it doesn’t work out. just generally being more resilient but not ignoring how i feel. which is good. also i unironically had breakdowns everyday too. idk if kaitlyn likes me, i’m starting to doubt it but i won’t take away her chance just bc she’s slow at texting. but generally feeling not that bad about it, just in my acceptance stage ig. don’t really want a gf before uni but also i can’t control my feelings so i’ll probably fall for her again on wednesday. so many sports to watch everyday. today watched csgo, lol, vct, nhl and nba. like bruh. the constant consuming of media. gonna be home alone. lit ig.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

_a6-i">another i can’t sleep so i’m posting. sleep schedule is fucked cause i either stay up or wake up at 5 to watch a league of legends tournament. pretty cringe tbh. but lately i’ve been embracing the cringe and it’s making me happier. just cringe when people i trust call me cringe. shit hurts. i’m just a big nerd too, can’t take that shit away from me. which is weird, feel like i act so not nerdy on the exterior. beginning to think the exterior i put up is such a shit representation of my identity. 

starting to think kaitlyn isn’t really interested due to just generally long responses. maybe she just isn’t on her phone but i kinda hate texting her, it’s so talking stage. we will see wednesday tho, hopefully our convo will be as nice as it was. also i asked her to hang out and she said “i’m in toronto” and that was the biggest bruh moment. hopefully she actually does want to tho. still have hope just cause of our irl convos but if things are proven wrong, it’s over. it’s nice having these crushes ig. i’m not trying to be too emotional over it, ik a lot of the emotions i feel rn is cause it’s late at night. 

at the gym today thought about how the only time i felt valued in badminton or my parents were proud of me is when i showed how hard i worked. i never was able to win so i just tried to show i was more hard working than everyone else. coaches used to say that shit all the time and it made me really proud. makes me hella pretentious at the gym in my head just cause i feel like i have to prove i’m harder working to myself. pretty cringe. also thought about how i was hard working but never got any results bc i would get mental gapped. i asked myself if it was my fault, like that scene from good will hunting lol. maybe the right answer is it’s not my fault bc immense pressure was put on me, i never got any emotional support from my parents and my dad tried to live his dream thru me. but idk, i don’t want to admit that shit. made my entire gym day become just me despairing. 

ik i shouldn’t think too much of this but i’m really scared to date kaitlyn and go to uni. i almost want to hold off on my feelings and save them for a girl in uni. that’s not how it works but.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAJP3ztkWhyxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17907565985542745" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAJP3ztkWhyxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17907565985542745"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/283605993_1003633237183317_9142955274290759463_n_17996603368454168.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAJwk3S8an8BgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17923596437372972" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAJwk3S8an8BgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17923596437372972"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAMSMSbpeNUBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17918779007513859" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAMSMSbpeNUBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17918779007513859"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/283246420_1091847224738040_2994471573060938951_n_17914960652364093.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAKMzMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17980300117522638" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAKMzMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17980300117522638"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/282622216_323174729970040_5195690071795427491_n_17921191238293742.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202205/282622216_323174729970040_5195690071795427491_n_17921191238293742.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAInvnbItDlhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17941877584908890" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAInvnbItDlhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17941877584908890"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/283082245_1707875532881102_9123645192006446428_n_17949861952799653.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">May 22, 2022, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">part 2

slide 2 &amp; 3: not as much as a change as other poses. but more of a v-shape. muscles def more defined. 

slide 4 &amp; 5: more v-shaped again. and look at those fucking veins i’ve developed.

slide 6 &amp; 7: ong no difference it’s so hard to see any difference in legs. maybe i just start measuring idk. 

slide 8 &amp; 9: lowkey not fair to judge cause poses are lowkey different. chest is bigger and look how vascular my arms are.

weight progress:
squats 205 -&gt; 235 (pre pog!!)
hip thrusts 175 -&gt; 245 (pre good but started lower than i could at first)
leg press 350 -&gt; 420 (not a good measure of strength but crazy 😵‍💫)
db press 50-&gt;60 (plateauing on bench press kinda madge, since it’s db tho it’s like a 20lb increase. my chest size increase is disproportionate to my weight increase)
db curls 17.5-&gt;25 (pog asf increase)
tricep extension 15-&gt;30 (legit unethical increase)

okay so this all really started 3 weeks ago. i went out with lisa, stephen and thomas. and like lowkey, i thought lisa liked me or took an interest in me with the way she’s acting and her body language (it’s cringe if i say what tho) and it really makes me go “huh? i wonder if this girl likes me.” what really puts a nail in the coffin is when she saw my spam and said “i would read every single one of your posts.” the problem with me (my therapist just tells me not to think so much and embrace it) is i fall for girls so fucking easily over simple statements. generally, i make my judgements on people really fast and can point out red flags easily. so the opposite is true, if i see a green flag or a potential of one i fall so hard. and that simple statement was like me being like “damn what if someone actually wanted to go to know me” (a bait ofc). so a mf falls for this girl. and i start talking to her over dms and i ask her if she wants to hang. during this, lisa’s best friend, subin, on her own accord is telling lisa that she wants me and lisa to date, ig cause we look good together. so i ask lisa to go thrifting with me and we go. at first, i thought it went really well, idk felt giddy and shit. like during</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202205/281952296_418385076487783_3899896196548989405_n_17991878056475492.jpg"><img

like i’m regressing really hard. starting to feel like every night my emotions feel uncontrollable. like idk, i’m feeling a lot more anxious ig? instead of stresssed. idek what anxiety feels like tbh. but i feel more panicked sometimes instead of just wanting to kms. idk tho hs really aren’t going well. feel like i’m way more fucking irritable rn. honestly i need to tart chilling on hating idk. feel like i’m always in emotional turmoil. wanna run away and just never talk to anybody ik rn again. idk i’ve been feeling so uncontrollably ashamed of who i am and who i was in the past. i didn’t do anything i just really hate myself. huh we’re back to this pattern of self-deprecation. idk i just feel so ashamed of who i am. and i just get immensely insecure about how everyone perceives me and this account. idk i want to deactivate this account really badly but it’s so fucking addicting idk. i just think about the posts and in the past and idk i feel like i just said some shit i shouldn’t

how i’m feeling. idk, feeling like ass. just haven’t been okay. everything feels like it’s falling apart and school is ending soon and i just can’t wait till high school is over. i mean let’s be real here, high school has been probably the worst phase of my life. it was a lot of pain, like a lot and i never really found what i was looking for. i can’t wait to be out. atleast i learned a lot about myself and the world. matured a lot. still have a lot to learn. maybe i should put this spam behind and journal by myself. tbh i really like the format tho where i post random memes and the fact that people read them encourages me. sometimes i don’t want to write bc ik people will read them. i really hope this doesn’t develop into a body dysmorphia but i honestly look at myself in the mirror a lot. it makes me really happy seeing my improvements and just looking good idk. it’s kind of what i do to cope, prob not the best but idk. i really hope i can just find some people i connect with in hs. idk i find it really hard to find friends that i feel comfortable venting too. i feel like that’s a relationship thing which is weird. but that’s probably bc i haven’t felt comfortable venting to a lot of friends that it just doesn’t seem attainable. all my hopes and dreams are put into going to university. hopefully it doesn’t disappoint. genuinely feel like theres too much wrong with me that nobody would want to date me. i don’t blame them tho. been actually crying every night. things been going to shit recently for no reason</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

sure i got triggered by the most meaningless and insignificant interaction with someone that i’m too embarrassed to talk about. maybe it was who said it but idk that 30 second interaction ruined my whole day. which was pog asf! i love when 30 seconds randomly ruins my day and anything i try to make it better doesn’t work! today just feels like such a regress bc im feeling sad for no reason. and i’m just turning back to old habits. and rn the pain just feels really uncontrollable, like how it used to feel. i just want to fucking die so badly idk. i feel like with my reason want for power and to be untouchable comes from my disdain from being pitied all the time. idk i feel like i used that as a fallback when i didn’t get respect. but now it’s different ig. i mean what’s new tho? same story, different telling, i feel lonely as ever and never feel validated, before i tried to use pity to feel validated but now i want to be untouchable to feel validated. idk it’s bad today, feel like i’m regressing so much. in general too, been having a lot more breakdowns, rn tho idk feels like the old days! remember when this was every spam post! where i would be uncontrollably sad! i really want to just go no contact with everyone rn, i’m so sick of everyone and idk i just want to isolate rn. and i don’t want to go to school. idk i’m just so fucking done with everyone, i feel like things are falling apart with my friends anyways. like idk. also i just want to fucking sob. i haven’t sobbed in like two years i stg. i just want to fucking cry all my tears. but all i get is some pathetic little tears instead. pog i’m emotionally unavailable! who would want to date someone mentally ill anyways. people really don’t want to be with you when they find out who you really are. i can’t blame them, the emotional baggage that comes with knowing what i go through probably is exhausting. i can’t do that for others so why do i expect someone to do that for me. i mean why would anyone fucking bother looking at me anyways. i’m a fucking mess and i have way moore enemies then friends. i have nothing going for me.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

gym today was genuinely a very good time. idk i was happy. but i spend a couple of hours at home and it hits. maybe it’s cause better call saul is a depressing show. but idk, that’s why i’m so eager to do things with friends, can’t spend too long in the house. don’t have a sense of community. honestly feel like lately been egoing v hard and just wanting power idk. i just want to be untouchable. i was designing my suit yesterday and that’s fun but some part of me wants to just look untouchable. like the fit is so good you’re intimidated to talk to me. there’s a lot of other cases ig, where i just want others to know i’m smarter than them or stronger etc. ig i have a superiority complex rn. idk i feel like i don’t try to flaunt too much tho, it’s almost harder hitting if ppl realize rather than me showing. ig it’s good i don’t flaunt. i mean ik i just want to feel better than everyone as a means of protection. i just don’t want people to realize how much of a mess i am, esp the ppl i hate. i’m just scared people won’t respect me ig. or just seeming weak. actually fuck all that. ik what i’m really scared. i’m scared of opening up to a bunch of people i hate. i just feel like such a dumbass when i open up to someone and realize they’re not what i thought. or they say some shit that wasn’t helpful at all. and i feel so disappointed. i also hate when i get put in a position where i feel like i have a responsibility to do something in a relationship rather than my own will. shit is ass. so what i do unconsciously instead is seem like a stoic individual that has nothing wrong. and it’s fucked. i mean this is probably the natural outcome of what’s happened in the past. feel like i’ve been abandoned by everyone. my parents, grace, amina’s friend group, idek. and i just don’t want to be abandoned again. shit is actually one of my triggers lmao. i mean ik the path i lead to be untouchable(haha this is the theme of vagabond!) is self-destructive, i’m abandoning everyone before they abandon me, and i’ll chill but idk. i just don’t want to be left alone again. i mean i feel like..</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

is so shit i look kinda bad in these pics lol. i feel like i’m really good at reading people and their characteristics and can honestly determine if i’m going to be close with them in the first couple interactions or if i’m going to hate them. it’s honestly really cringe tho, bc i genuinely feel like every time i doubt my intuition, my intuition ends up being right. and idk it’s just really cringe bc it’s like knowing your fate before you die, all the surprise or hope is never really there. plus i feel like i never give people a chance to prove me wrong bc i’ve been right so many times. idk genuinely it sounds so egotistical to say but i actually feel like i can just read character well. and i feel like i’ve gotten really good at it. i honestly hate it tho. i just hate knowing how things will play out. idk. todays been a good day tbh, actually popped off on my math test and i’m really happy about that, leg day was so fun today was so happy. but idk rn, maybe it’s cause i haven’t done anything in the night, but i’m feeling really depressed. i mean idk. i had my therapy session and i talked about a lot of hard things ig. i mean everyday i feel like i can only be content with living by myself for a certain amount of time. and after that i kinda realize how much is missing. idk i actually feel like if a girl told me she loved me (and like she actually did) i’d actually break down and start crying. it’s really been a long time huh? man idek freud wins idek anymore idk anything. seriously tho i gotta stop putting this stoic persona. idk it’s so easy to put on and feel confident about myself. idk if i wanna take it off. cause if a mf broke down and cried nobody would help pick me up. damn need someone to hold me xd</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

history arc rn, learning a lot about geography and  flags. but also been learning about chinese history, like idk the opium war, why taiwan is an “independent state”, why macau and hong kong are special. also learned about why japan said fuck it and bombed pearl harbor. finally decided to learn about the palestine conflict and why israel is a country. palestine is the un’s taiwan. just been going off reading wikipedia articles everyday and learning a lot of new things about history. this the problem with picking what major i wanna do, i go in and out of knowledge phases, summer was english grind phase, semester 1 lowkey was chem phase, 2022 to now was lowkey an engineering/physic phase (factorio), and now i’m on my history grind. idk i love learning so much but i genuinely don’t know if i will ever be able to settle down on a major and idk what major that would be. there’s just a lot of really interesting things to learn about and idk tbh i just like using my brain. honestly a part of me doesn’t want to go to uni, i feel like when i get put under workload i won’t be able to explore random knowledge i wanna explore. idk i’ve always been an active thinker, maybe it’s the adhd but my mind just doesn’t rest. recently tho, mind has been going off, i find myself asking questions about everything and my mind is constantly trying to answer questions about things in my daily life and v piss random things. for example, bc the philippines was a us colony, jolibee went off there bc chicken wings is the us “cultural food.” i think i just have the brain capacity to think about these random things bc of the lessen workload and it’s nice. also i feel like what’s contributed a lot is less emotional turmoil. feel like in middle school and early high school i would just think about what i want in life and how to deal with my parents and idk. topics that required a lot of emotional processing. but now those topics have been put to rest, i have a lot more energy and room to learn about the world. idk i genuinely love learning a lot and thinking. maybe it’s my way of conquering the world through…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

good today tbh. picked up my sister from the airport and that’s nice. weve been talking and i can confidently say that she’s the only person in my life that’s a hater like me. we just hate. shit is kinda lit. actually need me a gf that hates as much as me. i’m a certified hater for life. i live to hate. anyways bought flowers for mother’s day and i ate with my family for the first time at the table. can’t lie the first interaction with my mother i was immediately uncomfortable. i came home from the gym and then she was like “carsyn’s goes to the gym so much susie you should go to the gym too bc you’re waist hurts and to get healthy.” i just thought like damn first interaction with her and she’s alr comparing me to my sister :/. and then after she tells me to show my muscle and idk that made me feel uncomfortable and mom always comments on my body and idk it feels really fucking weird and i don’t like it a lot. and then dad started going off on advice to my sister too about being healthy and goals in life. idk when i go back not excited for these talks. but it also summarizes my relationship with my parents, i know they are still supposed to be our parents but all they talk about is advice or trying to better us. our relationship isn’t built on genuine connection or love but just them trying to do what’s best for us. and sure they have good intentions but constantly being barraged by improvements that can be made and never by the effort that’s currently being put or the skills that are currently present easily lead to just not feeling good enough. and it’s just not a way to build a connection with anyone. cringe tbh, been more than a year where they’ve “tried to improve themselves” but things never really change. also cringe how my mom can’t tell i’m fucking uncomfortable whenever she comments on my body. but honestly i’m not really affected by what they did today, it just reinforces the distance i alr put in our relationship. and i was pre happy today. talked to my sister for a couple of hours which is nice. new spyxfamily eps was wholesome. played some fortnite. that’s all</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

conversation with steven about piss random shit and that was enjoyable. was a nice convo. had my leg day and i was so fucking anxious bc last two leg days i’ve gotten exertion headaches. however, i lowered my sets and stopped training to failure so much to reduce systemic fatigue and i didn’t get a headache. super fucking pog. i’m really glad i didn’t get a headache. and the leg day was really fun. just had a lot of energy for it and i got hyped asf. just happy i can start doing leg days again. bc of my breakdown yesterday i felt really ass this morning. but had a quick pivot and decided to just be a maniac. i don’t want to use that word to make it seem like i have bpd, but every time a depressive episodes passes i act so fucking insane. i alr act so fucking insane but idk i’m just even more unhinged. idk i just be yelling in the car and shit and cussing mfs out in my car. or i just talk to myself saying some outlandish shit. idk tbh it’s pre brain dead and i be saying some mentally ill shit. it’s pre cringe if i quote myself but i just have a lot of outbursts. being depressed like a drug tho, these random moments where i just act off the walls is genuinely kinda fun. its kind of like i’m choosing a life of a drug addict. my hit is when i suddenly become insane. and then when i’m sad i’m just like i want to be at peace. i’m not kidding, does mental stability even exist?</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202205/FQIoAkMzLBdAI0Yk3S8aoBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17935651730122373" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank"

filled with despair tbh. i had a pretty big high these last couple of days but now it’s worn off and i’m just sad asf. i guess it’s natural for my happiness to be complimented by sadness but idk i just want to be at peace. feel like i just deluded myself for a couple of days. and now reality is hitting and i’ve realized how shitty my life is going to be. i go to one class everyday, don’t see any friends and just play video games. unrelated but i got forced to eat with this girl named chantelle alone and i legit wanted to blow my brains out. it was a little fun bc since idgaf about her i said whatever i wanted. idk i just said some really random shit and it’s really fun just saying dumb statements and impulsively lying about really absurd things so they don’t know what to believe about you. it’s also really fun to freely roast people and be v sarcastic. back to what i was originally saying, life feels like it’s going to be so soulless this summer. tbh i just feel like crying rn. idk feel like there’s just a lot of thoughts jumbled up in everything. feel like i’m actually always setting myself up for failure, not to have a destructive mentality but idek why i try anymore. like idk does it ever get better? i might be doing better mentally but like idk feel like everything has been this uphill battle for things to get better and i still don’t feel fulfilled. feel like i’ve felt this lonely for years now. i’ve had moments where those feelings are gone but that’s all they are, moments. the constant of my despair never makes the happiness worth it. i just don’t want to feel alone. honestly, every spam post on this spam is just that, i just want to have people that i feel comfortable with telling everything that goes in my head. but idk, will that ever happen. feels like i’ve never been fully myself to anyone. i don’t want to put up this facade everyday. honestly i feel like a lot of people think i’m really sure about myself and really confident about everything. i feel like i’m really good at pretending. but idk in reality i just don’t want people to see how desperate and lonely i…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

today but i’m feeling giddy. didn’t do shit all morning and i went to school and did my math and talked to nick and subin the entire spare. feel like there’s so much tea everyday i honestly kinda like it. on the contrary tho, i feel like my friend group is going to end up fucking imploding. but idk there’s always some crazy shit to talk about or banter about too. but idk it might be fucked. i feel like i’ve always felt this way about my friend group tho, i didn’t like some of them a lot and that’s cause i just felt like some things about them can be really problematic and they have been. i’m also concerned i might do something that might make shit implode. shits just tense rn idk. but it’s fun being a part of the drama, it’s just brain dead asf. talked to my therapist about it and she just to be myself which is what she says all the time but she’s right. idk man feel like things in my life are gonna change drastically very soon and shits bouta go down. maybe not tho. other than that i played this coop game with steven and it’s so brain dead cause i have no idea wtf i’m doing and i end up just hard trolling and this guy comes and hard bails me out. it’s funny asf tho. honestly have gotten really close with steven and i actually love this guy now that i think about it. idk it’s nice talking to him about piss random shit and im def closest to him in the friend group. we do a lot of things together, play league, watch lcs/vct, and play piss random coop games. but it’s fun asf. we also hard bond on youtube documentary’s. idk love this guy tbh. its just funny asf talking to him idk. just happy today, lots of things to be positive about. maybe tomorrow i’ll be in pain. but atleast today was a good and smiling day.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

can’t workout as hard as i usually can i’ll actually get tilted. i’m actually mad and sad. i went suit shopping today and my headache was bad so i had an overall bad experience. all the suits are hella expensive too. plus idk i feel so small in a suit. like genuinely feel petite asf and if kinda makes me sad that i look so tiny. maybe the body dysmorphia is catching up to me. but idk i just felt tiny in my suit and it just made me sad. and also i’ve realized i hate suits. like there’s no way to express yourself with a suit. unless i buy like a runway balenciaga suit or smth all the suits look the same to me. i just hate the extremely fitted look of a suit too. idk it’s just such a boring outfit. like maybe ill look handsome in one but idk. it’s just so fucking boring. not to be cringe but wearing this suit makes me feel like a corporate tool. idk. suit shopping was ass cause my head hurt, i feel so small and i hate how boring suits are. today was ass day tbh. shit i don’t even want to go to the banquet anymore cause i have to buy a suit. but like that’s not gonna happen bc i’m gonna go to see my friends. but i was honestly considering it. also i don’t like going out with my mom. shit still feels so uncomfortable. and i just get annoyed. today is such an ass day but it’s like nothing actually happened that was that bad. just feels bad idk</div><div class="_3-95

play with george, idk it’s really fun playing with him and i raised him up to be such a good doubles player and he’s such a fast learner. honestly school badminton is really fun so it’s a bittersweet ending to everything. it’s also crazy to think that my badminton career is actually over. this is&#064;prob my last tournament. idk man. it’s nice i ended on a high note but it’s crazy to think about how i’ll prob never play a tournament ever again. the joy i had from playing school badminton and cheering on others is something i won’t be able to feel ever again. that shit feels fucked up. idk man. won’t ever be as hyped as i was playing with george. i have a physics exam tmmrw and lowkey, i just decided fuck it i don’t want to study. just gonna say fuck it for this test. for fun ig. idek. prob a dumbass idea but whatever. life is changing so fast, i’m basically done school. gonna be living so much more isolated and i need to find a job. i’m looking at the words coming up on my suggested words and mommy is coming up way too often… that’s fucked up. i just don’t want things to change and even tho hs has been unironically the worst experience in my life (tried to kms!) i wanna stay. it’s more of a comfort thing than anything. and i just have a lot of anxiety of what my life is gonna look like. getting a job makes me feel old and i prob won’t meet friends at my job. just have anxiety that i won’t ever find people that i can feel safe with. my therapist told me change is like grief. bc grief comes from a result of something that has changed. never thought about it like that. hopefully things will change for the better</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202204/FQIoAkMzLBdAKxDlYEGJNxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17968637503602386"

slide 4 &amp; 5 thoughts: still a big difference between both arms but the difference is mainly in the tricep. tbh not much improvement but chest development is a lot more.

slide 6 &amp; 7 thoughts: chest is way bigger in this. shoulder showing more striations. focusing on left arm bc just trying to balance the unevenness. 

slide 8 &amp; 9 thoughts: shoulder showing a bit more striations. arm generally bulkier not much diff tbh.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

just taking off my shirt i always end up admiring my physique. it’s nice. talked mad shit about janine to all my friends. shit is so hype. i genuinely love hating. happy asf. also met with tom and ryan cao and it’s always nice to see my uni friends. so pogged tbh. just exhausted rn, watched some more gintama. life feels okay rn but when im at the gym i was going to cry bc i felt so lonely. glad

wanted to stay home yesterday but i didn’t so i decided i would today. just feeling melancholic. stayed home today in hopes to start to be motivated to go to the gym and to start applying for jobs. luckily i did one and went to the gym and was really happy about it. ill post a physique update on saturday. most nights i spend alone in my room with my lights off scrolling my phone. i use cheap entertainment to try to entertain me. lately i’ve been watching low effort content, like tiktok’s of askreddits voiceovered. started watching gintama again and i enjoy it. problem with anime is it’s a risk on whether i enjoy it or not and it’s more commitment. it’s easier to choose cheap and mindless entertainment. even if it’s not as fulfilling. generally going to school sucks, it’s just become so mundane and boring lately. feel like the passion i’ve had just been sucked out. also just don’t like my friends that much tbh, honestly i feel like i have a minor problem with someone else every week. the two major problems i have every week are darsan and janine but new ppl piss me off every week. honestly i like the core but once i get farther out, the more i dislike ppl. but ig it’s just random problems. makes me feel lonely asf. lately i’ve been really yearning a deep connection with someone. maybe it’s cause i haven’t been working out as much lately and i honestly hope it really is that bc that’s an easy fix. speaking of, it’s hard to start working out again. but i force myself bc ik the motivation will come after. and today was a good day at the gym so it makes me wanna go tomorrow. but yeah i’ve been yearning for a girl. i keep on hearing about these little things that peoples partners do to show their affection and it’s pretty damn cute. it makes me realize that i haven’t had that in so long. or idk i’ve just been thinking about physical intimacy and idek how that feels like anymore. maybe that’s why it took me so longer to get over my ex, it’s not like i really got over her i just forgot. now idek how it feels anymore. honestly it really never feels like i’ve been emotionally intimate with…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

were all at nicks house. and i got really fucking drunk. and im already honest as shit so when im drunk im just even more honest. so i just randomly tell janine you’re face cheeks are kinda chubby. and she gets kinda offended im like nah it’s not a bad thing it’s just a feature of your face. and tbh they are chubby. it’s like they kinda chubby in the way where a baby’s face is chubby and you kinda wanna play with her cheeks. everyone interpreting this as i’m lowkey calling her fat tho which i’m not. like bro you can have chubby cheeks and not be fat. and idk she got offended but like okay bro i just said this is a feature of your face. i didn’t say it was bad idk tbh i kinda like the chubby cheeks. but everyone is like bro you’re so brain dead and i can see where there coming from and i can see how she can interpret how i’m calling her fat but like simply i’m not. and she’s projecting way too much by making my chubby cheeks comment about her body, im talking about a facial feature. this might be cringe take but generally i can’t comment on someone’s feature. i remember one time i told subin like “you shouldn’t compare your body to lisa bc you guys have completely different body types.” everyone on that mf table just interpret that as me calling her fat but the basis of my point is not to compare your body to anyone else and to accept your body. but idk i’ve never had body dysmorphia issues so maybe i’m just mad ignorant. i’m still thinking about that shit and i still don’t get how it’s that offensive to call her cheeks chubby, it’s legit just a feature of her face and she should embrace that. it’s clear i wasn’t making fun of her for it. comment what you think maybe i’m delusional. whatever after that situation she’s was super passive aggressive towards me. problem with that for her is that i genuinely don’t care. like that day saif asked me to be like roast me. and i was like i don’t like your fit today. and then janine chimes in and was like “bro yk what sometimes you just like a grandpa and you think you’re the shit.” after the fact it was clear she was trying to offend…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

went home from the gym early cause ong was just depressed. kinda sad but whatever idk. watched a pog fucking valorant game and my team won. then watched some lcs with my friend. honestly being sick sucks cause going to the gym sucks. but it adds insane comedic effect. i’m a very emphatic person and the coughing after i exert too much effort is funny asf. like ill become super pressed and then ill just start coughing after and idk i think it’s fucking funny asf. i feel like an old ass boomer on his death bed being pissed at something. plus it just emphasizes my point, i’m like so passionate about whatever i’m saying i end up sacrificing my health to emphasize my point. rant 2 is i hate the internet. like genuinely, i can’t stand politicaltok or any political discourse online bc it’s so fucking cringe. like that hassan guy is kinda cringe can’t lie. like i’ve been genuinely wishing death to some ignorant ass people bc they just piss me off so much. like when i watch karen videos i just wish they genuinely got beat tf up to a pulp. genuinely wish sometimes i didn’t live in a democracy with these dumbass people. idk man. i just have such immense hatred for these people. that being said, i’m so fucking chronically online it’s insane. like i was watching this popular streamer tarik and he didn’t know what ara ara meant or acab and im like wtf these are baseline phrases. but generally im just so chronically online it’s cringe. i feel like there’s these random moments when i realize this isn’t how normal people talk and im like damn. like my music taste, films, anime and books are just the most chronically online takes. or i just know the most random facts in the world. like my political views is prob a very chronically online take (even tho it could be a lot worst). and like i prob know about a lot of random conspiracy theories and internet lore (like cicada 3301, fnaf lore, reddit horror stories like that drm free delete guy) that idk it’s insane that normal ppl

squat day bc idk how much weight i wanna put on. hopefully i can still progressively overload tmmrw. not much to think about, woman in the gym unironically make me feel very insecure, idk i just think they be judging me. gym wasn’t that bad today i’m glad i did it but it was kinda bad. stopped coughing as much. need to actually apply for jobs so i can make money for a vacation. not much thoughts. wish i could talk to a girl or smth. i just wanna fall in love and shit. this being single shit is so boring bro unironically. sometimes i hear this story on reddit of this cute couple shit and i’m like man fuck why can’t that be me. i just got these shitty tiktok’s that are kinda funny that i post. i’m horny posting too much on my spam story like bro needs to actually talk to woman. man idek. just need gf buff ong. also getting back into the gym after not going is kinda hard. plus i just got tilted cause i lift less weight :(. but it’s fun going to the gym. and i like looking at my body.

sick but def way better, went to school today and actually grinded my balls off. studied a lot for math and did a physics unit test. have to write two gla tmmrw which i’m not excited for and a math unit test. i gotta start applying for jobs tryna go somewhere with my friends. desperate ig, some girl put some effort in talking to me and i’ve been thinking about it. pre sad that’s how the standards are dawg, not thinking about her hard but idk it comes up in my mind. prob get over that shit pre soon tho. it would be nice to actually talk with girl, but idk prob feeling this desperate bc i haven’t been to the gym in a week, so i don’t really have my usual fulfillers in life. it just feels weird thinking about how i don’t really have a chance for a serious relationship till like atleast september at uni, idk it’s just something i want ig. also a crazy thought that uni is so soon. honestly school is hype asf, plus it makes being at home better bc you spend less time not doing anything on your phone (even tho i just be doing nothing at school). idk just happy to see my friends again even if it means talking to insufferable npcs again. damn i lowkey just wanting a girl rn

accidental pregnancy and then i marry her to save face but our marriage falls apart and i start raising the child as a single father and then i realize when my child is 14 that it’s not my child and then i continue to raise the child myself and then i get my money up and then i listen to gangster trap flexing on hoes. (idek what that bit was about). fr tho it’s just a type of night where i will pretend to be infatuated with someone. just cause i’m bored and lonely. and want someone cute. maybe i just go for something casual idk. but with whomst? idk. unironically what if i start dating a milf. been thinking about that unironically. lowkey thought i was a switch but dawg i just might be a sub. damn dawg

year. shit is lit dawg. pre common when you recover. honestly miss it a lot, i remember coming back from school napping for 4 hours and then sleeping at 11. shit was genuinely lit. making this spam post to talk about me being sick, genuinely the worst physical condition i’ve ever been. had the worst headache all of yesterday. literally fucking headache. had like a 38.5 fever and was so fucking thirsty. like genuinely the entire day i was so thirsty. like i would drink water till i lowkey felt like throwing up and would still be thirsty. i hate the taste of water now. i feel like i’ve drank my body in water. my head hurt so much yesterday that i genuinely wasn’t on my phone that much, just closing my eyes trying to rest. and if i couldn’t sleep i’d try to watch something but my head hurt so much it was hard to focus on the video and it was not worth it. first 15 hours of me being sick i didn’t sleep more then 30 minutes at a time, mostly would half sleep and then wake up super fucking sweaty, go pee (which wouldn’t have an ounce of yellow in it), cool off, get cold, try to drink as much water as possible and try to fall asleep again. pre sure last night i went to bathroom at least 10 times. shit was horrible. but today i’m feeling better, at least good enough to write this post. the major symptom rn is that my throat feels so dry and uncomfortable. can barely talk and shit. honestly really scared my sickness will get in the way of my gains. idk don’t have much of an appetite and i’m just kinda dying. also a really bad symptom was my legs were so sore and weak bc i worked them really hard and they weren’t able to recover properly bc i got sick. being sick is fucking ass man. haven’t felt physically this bad in my life ong. when i get old and i feel this physically shit i’m telling the doctors to put me under</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202204/n4uS98FAFQIoAkMzLBdAMwAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17925872387209479"

planning a trip to a resort with friends and we basically all agreed to not tell darsan about it bc bro we’re all not down for him to join us LOL. but i’m gonna chill with darsan as i said, won’t be a hater. trained legs today and honestly they very sore. but idk progressed a lot in my squat today and shit makes me happy. also i actually have huge quads, guess lucky genes idk. darsan lowkey a bitch and be complaining and shit. went to 8 on 205 for 3 sets for my squats and final set just sent it and went 225 for 2 which is just pog asf. squat progress is actually fucking insane. didn’t hit 135 on bench but ong i can’t hit it. im almost certain i can. just was tired today. ong me and george are lowkey tight, he’s pog asf in badminton and lowkey i’ve been teaching him how to play doubles and he is able to apply what i teach him so fast. like he’s a fast learner in school but i didn’t think it would correlate to badminton. he’s so pog at doubles. and ong ever since i’ve been on my adhd meds i’ve been nerdging out. in physics i’m literally practicing paper 1 for physics for fun. shits just entertaining todo and whenever idk how to do a question i just ask george. idk this guy is so pog tho. it’s fun nerdging out with him. idk we tight now. bad day yesterday but today was just pog, taking a trip for the summer sounds lit esp without darsan. also not having english class is so fucking nice. idk just had a bad day yesterday but been consistently having good days. also i just feel huge idk. can’t stop staring at the clip of me flexing my back, the drop is so perfect and idk i just like how it looks. might not actually be that big but i feel v big. feeling good</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

listening to swans and earl while i’m working out. that’s how yk im bouta end it. went home and flexed my pump cause idk i like seeing my progress and it’s kinda fun. but it ended up being a good decision, couple hours later i was just comparing my progress and i’m really proud of myself. it’s crazy how big my chest is and even my back has improved in like two weeks. my arms used to be v lanky but now they’re no longer twigs. dunno just looked at vids of me flexing and got happier. still glad i went to the gym today. it pissed me off a lot but it wasn’t bad. generally was v irritable today, honestly prob gonna chill on hating darsan even tho he makes me mid. i have to workout with him tmmrw bc i was gonna workout with nick and he ended up inviting him. kinda tilted but idk i won’t gatekeeping shit ig. i just hate how he is invading my life shits cringe. and the gym is just where i’m most vulnerable and idk i don’t want him where i feel vulnerable. but whatever i’ll start to relax, i gotta stop hating so much. also gotta chill with my gym ego, i want to lift heavier then all the ppl i hate and i just gotta remember why i actually want to lift, just cause i love the pain. i gotta start encouraging myself more after i lift, ong it’s the negative mindset i had while playing badminton. i just set an unreasonable standard of how hard i push myself and if i don’t reach it i get disappointed. lately my egos been on fire and i think i just need to chill. idk there’s a lot of people i hate in my friend group but i gotta relax, they may be problematic but i just need to relax. just been irritable ig. but even if i hated them i couldn’t do anything except rip the friend group apart and that’s not worth it. i think i just gotta chill. tonight’s been rough but i’m working thru it. ill be more accepting of darsan. and ill let things slide. i don’t have to be close with ppl in the friend group, i can just let some exist. it’s not a dichotomy. this darsan guy got really pissed at me today, i just roasted him bc he took too long to play his cards. dawg lowkey was gonna hit me. i should just…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

_a6-i">dawg. i had to drive alone for a hour and lowkey driving alone is lit. i be giving so much unsolicited advice when i’m driving and it’s bc driving put me in a think about life type of mood. the whole way i’m just thinking about random shit, like how the only the thing i wanna do is be myself in life. or i was like damn these homeless ppl be stronger then me mentally, like unironically i’d jill myself if i was homeless cause dawg these ppl been abandoned by society since day 1. like if i was in there position i’d genuinely take my life. props to them for living thru all that genuinely. also i was the supermarket and had a holden moment. i posed this question to george a couple of days ago but you ever notice whenever you enter a big place like a restaurant or supermarket or like any store basically, there’s always two doors. like you enter two doors to get into somewhere. like you go into and then you go into another one and then you’re in the store. notice it when you go in to a store. like why is there two doors. so i asked this question to george on thursday. and as i was leaving the supermarket today, as i was leaving the second door a gust of cool air hit me. and i realized why there’s two doors. it’s cause by the time you enter the second door, the first door closes and it traps the heat inside or outside the building (whether the ac or the heat is on). and then i saw this random woman while i was walking back to my car and i asked her why there was two doors. and then she was so confused and didn’t know what to say and i just told her when you walk in you’ll walk into two doors. and then after i felt like holden from a catcher in the rye cause he i remembered he asked a taxi driver where the goose go in the winter and the taxi driver was like what the fuck bro i’m sure they live underwater. if you think about it i made a big impact in her life bc if she understood my question, she won’t be able to unsee the two doors that she’s gonna walk in to. the best part about solving the two door problem is that i didn’t search it up and i solved it myself. questions where you solve it yourself without anyone else’s help feels so good…</div><div

sleep schedule is fucked. prime productivity time is between 10pm-4am rn. prob my adhd meds but i crashed so hard last period today. was so tired at home and just spent the entire night watching gintama and took a quick nap until 10. might go off this adderall cause shits fucking up my sleep. that and over training. if you think about it my muscles build on rest days. started watching gintama and it’s pretty pog anime. theres a lot of comedy which can get pre boring tbh but it’s still a nice watch. honestly really not down to work on my oral, just seems like a lot of work and i’m kinda done. also i realized the i go to the gym to self harm things isn’t a joke; i did a v hard set and all i thought about after was I LOVE PAIN I LOVE PAIN I LOVE PAIN GIMME MORE PAIN. dawg idk the adrenaline just hit different. or i’m a masochist. but like genuinely the pain feels so good. feel like i’m fighting god or some shit. every post on this spam ends up being a gym post. actually a

like 15 sec and it looks like my soul is being sucked out. big ego boost bc after my last set there was this mf that looked at me like i was insane. i think it happened during my squats too. idk i like the fact that i train v intense gives me big ego boost. and seeing ppl be like this mf crazy makes me kinda happy. also i’m a range of motion god btw. i had a good leg day tho. idk what else to

scared i get body dysmorphia. nick has it and i asked him about it and he says that i prob will. idk i just don’t want to. feeling really fucking ass today emotionally. think a big factor is that i didn’t get any sleep last night and i’m a bit hungover, don’t have a big appetite either. just feeling really ass, really lonely. just feeling lonely in this world. i just wanna be at peace tbh. fought thru my workout and i’m really proud of that. but the loneliness in my life just lasts forever. felt like i was fighting demons tbh. like idk. felt like a failure too. yesterday i was feeling the same way during my workout but better then i felt today and i wrote (and ik how cringe this sounds) that i will surpass god. thought about how hard of a battle my life has been but i fight thru the pain. thinking about how i want god to do his worst on to me, and that me working out is just to spite him. that motivated me. been making me think of berserk in a new light. i be feeling like guts fighting against griffith even tho it’s hopeless. trying my best to face the pains of my life with full conscience. just to spite god. this whole bit was really cringe. i just workout to give

inviting himself. got super fucking wasted bc nick can make cocktails and his drinks were fucking hard as shit. those mfs tasted fucking good. didn’t throw up which was insane if you account for the fact that we drank a bottle each of like 55%. honestly had a lot of fun idk what else to say i really enjoy myself drunk in social situations. anyways after everyone left it was just me and nicks and i slept over and that shit was real. not gonna spill a lot of the tea here but just complicated situations and such. but idk we were both v drunk and just talking about our lives and it was nice. he just talked about how he just indulges just to cope. idk man but it was a long ass conversation and we’re def closer now. also we just talked about our motivation to workout and how we both don’t give a fuck about being healthy and how we just do it to cope. anyways idk shit was nice. but like i basically didn’t the entire night, i think i got like 5 hours of sleep. not that tired tho. idk last night was fun. being really drunk was fun but also just talking to nick about things was fun. like we went outside and smoked a cigarette and honestly that’s a core memory (don’t smoke kids!) idk just sitting outside and smoking and talking about these things was just such a vibe. we’re both v wasted and we’re just talking about our lives and situations. on a side note nick actually gets a lot of girls and he had a lot of stories about casual hookups and things like that. he is attractive tho. idk i asked him about if he rather have us or be at a hs party and he said this was way more fun. i always wished that i got invited to parties or had hookups but it just kinda seems it’s kinda overrated. i wouldn’t know tho. idk it was just that nick was telling me how much fun he had at my place and how everyone was talking to each other and i think nick was genuinely v happy.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

flexing
slide 2: feb 23, 2022 not flexing 
slide 3: march 25, 2022 not flexing
(thoughts on progress: can’t really see that much progress on not flexing, abs more defined, arms bigger and maybe chest, first photo was shit tho)

slide 4: flexing left arm march 6, 2022
slide 5: flexing left arm march 25, 2022
(thoughts on progress: wish i took more pics of me flexing earlier but shoulder bicep tricep chest and forearm have made huge growth. been focusing on my left arm bc lots of muscle imbalance between both arms)

slide 6: flexing right arm march 6, 2022
slide 7: flexing right arm march 25, 2022
(thoughts on progress: less progress then left arm bc less focus on this arm. but shoulder and bicep and tricep more defined. can kinda see chest progress in this) 

slide 8: flexing left arm march 25, 2022 
slide 9: lat spread march 25,2022
slide 10: flexing back march 25, 2022
(wish i took pictures of my back earlier, but i think i’ve made insane back progress. lat spread looking fucking huge for some reason. like how my back looks)

general thoughts: really lean rn so i’m gonna be aesthetic, tryna bulk up to 160 so i gained like 6lbs in a month; it’s really hard to eat more 😖. eating ong harder then the gym. but next month ill def be less aesthetic. maybe ill show my leg progress but didn’t take any pictures of my legs. progress isn’t insane but i’m proud of it. ill post how much more i can lift in the comments.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/277289263_292975876243873_2233202068572812106_n_18119054401279927.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202203/277289263_292975876243873_2233202068572812106_n_18119054401279927.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/277433687_705445060480322_5452831339908867113_n_17959583023580960.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202203/277433687_705445060480322_5452831339908867113_n_17959583023580960.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/277216536_465307961945046_1956137379956254604_n_17900531264487622.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202203/277216536_465307961945046_1956137379956254604_n_17900531264487622.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/277451314_166269875748370_1939369846461909649_n_18151162624243991.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202203/277451314_166269875748370_1939369846461909649_n_18151162624243991.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202203/FQIoAkMzLBdACd0vGpdxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17919091322484187" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/FQIoAkMzLBdACd0vGpdxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17919091322484187"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/276967620_523798489093955_6441560112111915055_n_17966537068570287.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202203/276967620_523798489093955_6441560112111915055_n_17966537068570287.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202203/E3490F3F907949AACEAD244B33863DB4_video_dashinit_18157830910225346.mp4" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/E3490F3F907949AACEAD244B33863DB4_video_dashinit_18157830910225346.mp4"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202203/EE4733B90380291DC1FB091DDDFD3A8F_video_dashinit_17907979274343639.mp4" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/EE4733B90380291DC1FB091DDDFD3A8F_video_dashinit_17907979274343639.mp4"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202203/964B474BB47FE4F66343CC12B8655CA3_video_dashinit_17933058851100440.mp4" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/964B474BB47FE4F66343CC12B8655CA3_video_dashinit_17933058851100440.mp4"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202203/FQIoAkMzLBdAFd0vGpdxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17916956222243895" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/FQIoAkMzLBdAFd0vGpdxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17916956222243895"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Mar 25, 2022, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">physique update tmmrw bc i didn’t have time to pose today and shit.

so fucking good. also i’m a range of motion god, every time i see mfs around with shit range of motion i get the biggest superiority complex. played badminton after and idk was not worth bc i was so tired after my workout if i called it a day i would’ve been happy. instead i was grumpy, tired and hungry after so that was not the move. badminton was okay tho i just wasn’t feeling the best. tmmrw i’m finna have an insane pump and ill post. lowkey tho you can’t really tell a difference between the two pics, i didn’t gain much weight. but like idk looking at myself my chest grew a lot and my

realized i hate getting praised. like every time i get praised by anyone i’m like fuck you i don’t do it for you i do it for me. like idk prob bc every time i got praised in the past it becomes an expectation. don’t want to raise ppl expectations cause i’ll just fail mfs. so don’t praise me bro. if you do i might get hard 😏. jkjk but still idk ppl praising me and shit actually triggers my fight or flight i’m not trolling. well depends on what but idk crazy shit i realized. got prescribed adhd meds and shit. forbidden pre workout. spring break going pre well even tho i haven’t done anything;

by starting a convo by taking a picture in a movie theatre to get invited. like that’s gotta be top 10 most cringe things i’ve ever heard i did that when i was in grade 7. also him saying i’m not cringe and then being like yeah i just tried to be v slick and get invited by happening to be in a movie theatre too. the next couple of texts were from like over a year ago. idk why i’m darsan posting but just cringe imo. me and steven legit playing among us, we’re tryna kick this guy out like he the imposter. but yeah lowkey we like networking behind the scenes, like steven texted saif and we’re both like why is he here, steven called ethan and is like why tf is he here and i texted nick and he’s okay with darsan being in the gc. but we’re slowly building a faction. idk man it’s just so cringe. that’s all i gotta say. however god is good bc he said he would workout today and i didn’t see him at the gym 🙏. thank you allah. he would’ve ruined another amazing leg day i had. ong ik i can squat way more then i do rn. and i be deadlifting shit make me feel&#064;like a beast. can’t believe i have a week of break rn. we hanging out on friday we see how that goes</div><div class="_3-95

_a6-i">this a post howard finna eat up. so basically darsan got added to this gc and like high key he’s friends with like 2/7 ppl in the gc. and like lowkey were bantering but also were kinda serious bc like who tf is this piss random that we don’t know. so we ask saif about and he’s like he asked me to join the gc and i just said yes bc i didn’t want to say no. and like highkey everyone just doesn’t know why he’s in it. so today me and steven are just on call talking and shit. and like we’re highkey flaming this guy cause we’re like bro why tf is he in our gc he’s literally a piss random to everyone. and then like a hour later he joins and he’s like bro how do i join a friend group. and idk i just start texting this steven guy tryna not to die laughing bc we were literally just flaming him and he’s asking us how to join our own friend group. so we’re both tryna collect ourselves over call and shit bc we’re just flaming him. and he literally asks us “should i ask to be a part of a gc” and i’m straight up like i’ve never asked to be a part of a gc. idk man this kinda seems mean spirited but it genuinely was so funny how we were flaming him and he asks. genuinely tho it was just so awkward that he asked us to join and shit and he’s def forcing himself onto our group. maybe i’m being the asshole here but like also it’s lowkey like that one guy that thinks he’s a part when he isn’t. if he just slowly became friends with everyone it would just be way less awkward. but also isn’t it the biggest throw in the world to ask the ppl advice on how to join their group. like it’s just too fucking funny idk. it’s funnier that he’s not tryna be direct about it either LOL. he’s tryna disguise it like he wants to join someone else. not to be egotistical or anything but i genuinely feel like darsan kinda admires me (tbh it’s kinda annoying). like after he just talked about how i could pull girls if i really tried just bc i’m outgoing and i apparently flirt with ppl unconsciously (which i totally think is cap he doesn’t know what actual flirting is). or like he tells me how i have good takes or very opinionated in a good way. or like how he’s lowkey copied my style and looks up to me…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202203/276000130_2813091532332013_2268465367523090620_n_17955930010714477.jpg"><img

tbh. i just like being a part of a team tbh. like genuinely i feel like i enjoy doubles a lot bc it’s just team oriented and i get hyped and i have fun. even if my partner isn’t as good as they could be. idk shit was fun. okay might roast half the spam saying this but lowkey i think i might’ve made subin cried over band shit. what happened was subin is in merch and she’s tryna sell these tote bags and like she was tryna sell it to george. at the start it was banter but soon it kinda devolved into lowkey harassment and it was kinda pissing me off. idk she just tried to sell her band merch to george for like 15 minutes and was so insistent about it. it just felt so long and she was so insistent. so lowkey i was kinda mean and rude and was like “the reason we make fun of band kids is cause they act like a cult.” obv this is an exaggeration but it’s true to an extent, she was saying things like “if you don’t buy merch are you even proud to be us” like buying into something proves your worth. and like just general guilt tripping. like this may sound worse then it is but it’s just genuine manipulation, you’re basically saying you’re not one of us if you don’t want to spend money. like obv you can be more involved in the community but still, you shouldn’t be guilt tripping someone for 15 minutes to buy something. like imagine there’s a person on the street that insists you buy something from them for 15 minutes. and also subin bragged about how she harassed ryan for 7 days to buy a tote bag (i think it’s harassment but she said “told him everyday for 7 days to buy a tote bag”). like sure i’m using big boy words which might demonize her more but honestly it’s fucking annoying. like just hearing her tell george for 15 min to buy a tote bag and guilt tripping him for not having any band merch is annoying. and there was just a lot peer pressure to. so i called her out on it. it was honestly pre harsh tho, i mean she prob worked hard on it but it doesn’t justify harassment and guilt tripping. i gotta chill with my delivery. but idk i think i made her cry bc when we left she was coming…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

instead. went to this badminton tournament. this shit been bothering but since our actual coach had to leave early he brought in this girl which was lowkey so annoying and a bitch. like lowkey at the start it was my bad bc i wasn’t paying attention and was late to my game. after that she just kept on giving me attitude and shit was so fucking annoying. like she would remind me before games and then sigh or eye roll or some shit and i was getting kinda fed up. then when i asked her when my game was cause i didn’t know she was like “do you even know who you play against?” like homie no wtf. why tf you think i’m asking. it doesn’t even mean shit who i play against either, all the teams were assigned numbers and idk which number was what. after that she kept calling my name way before my game was underway and i ended up arguing for just giving me attitude the whole night. and she was like well your team needs you you gotta stop talking to other ppl for team spirit!! and i was like bruh mf i can’t socialize with other teams. and then i tie my shoelaces really long so ppl think i trip and she was like haha your shoelaces are so long you’ll trip and fall. and i’m like bruh you’re so immature and losing the argument that you need to make fun of my shoelaces that’s pathetic. and then she’s like i’m not making fun of you i just care. and idk i was just pissed at her for giving me attitude and she said i was giving her attitude like idk bro this fucking bitch is so annoying. and she has the audacity to say i have no team spirit bc i don’t spend every dying moment with my school. like bro lemme just talk to other ppl it’s not that fucking deep. plus imo i have the most team spirit on the team. and apparently i gave her attitude like i gave her the eye or some shit but bro was giving me attitude the whole night and shit was genuinely pissing me off. i just ended the argument by saying if you don’t need anymore i’ll leave. she just represents everything i fucking hate with ppl that have given power for there jobs.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202203/FQIoAkMzLBdAJpmZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17919643550167912"

squats i was like i can go heavier. prob just getting more confident with the exercise. the deadlifts got me going 10lbs heavier. leg press i SENT IT and went 30lbs heavier. last set went to complete failure and i felt so good. those are the main improvements but i’m just feeling so confident rn bc idk my leg day was just fucking insane. all my gains fr going into my legs and no where else. idk leg day just go crazy bro. was in a really good mood at the start too which helped a lot. idk man every time i hit legs i feel so good about myself after. for legs it feels like i can really push myself and idk i just feel so fucking jacked after even tho my left arm be dumbbell curling 7.5lbs. BUT YEAH I BE FUCKING SQUATTING 135. okay that’s not a lot for a squat BUT IM A BIG MAN. half the gym can prob bench that 😭😭. idk man i’m just happy asf i’m pushing myself hard and making insane gains

leg day and i just suddenly felt v insecure and shit it was not good. idk there was just a lot of high schoolers and that intimidated me 😵‍💫. idk was just really intimidated. and then today idk i was just depressed bc i was supposed to hang out with someone but got canceled on (which i expected tbh) and i just generally felt like ass. but honestly felt really good after the workout and i admired my pump. but i had to go lighter and that made me depressed but i’m pre sure it’s cause my muscles were more exhausted then usual. not seeing the same amount of progress in my chest compared to everything else. i’m like 3lbs heavier so ig the sort of bulk is working, it’s really hard to shove food in my face. learned lowkey how to train to failure and it feels pre good. also changed my routine to the one nick gave me. idk gym posting sm but literally i got home today laid in my bed for a couple of hours and really wanted to go back to the gym bc i had nothing to do. life just sucks that much and the gym is my happy place even when it’s not my happy place bc at the end i feel like i did something. hopefully this addiction doesn’t wear off and i just find other enjoyable things i like to do. progress was insane on leg day tho, increased my squat by 20lb (lowkey just had better form and pushed myself harder; will be pushing myself to abs failure next week) deadlift increased 10lbs (form still feels like some ass and prob only pushed myself harder) leg press by 20lb (prob will be higher next week and pushing myself harder) hamstring curl by 10 and leg extensions by 5. so yeah had an insane leg day even tho i wasn’t feeling insane. improved a bit on my push day too. i’ll never let a girl i’m interested in workout with me bc the faces i make are actually brain dead. maybe i might record myself but i’m pre sure recording is not allowed at my gym which is pre cringe. also feel like i need to increase my protein intake. idk gym posting a lot but it just feels good to improve. my glutes and quads are sore asf and it feels good. leg day hurts so good i love it. the gym just makes me feel better about</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

die from the bar. but high key i did this set and i pushed myself really hard cause on gp came on and that shit is both hype and sad and idk shit fucking motivated me. overall an okay day at the gym today. went home played some super auto pets. then decided to scroll 4chan paranormal board to see how valid some of these conspiracy theories are and become based. idk tho ended up wasting so much time seeing how many ppl predicted ww3 by browsing the archive. a lot of ppl predicted ww3 to start on feb 22, 2022 which is pre close to when russia invaded on the 24th but you have to take into account that these mfs prob just chose this day bc 22/02/2022 is a once in a lifetime day. but also russia recognized two nations in ukraine which was seen as a declaration of war on the 21st which was pre close to midnight so idk something to consider. prob a coincidence imo but the post was made in 2017. there was a couple predicting ww3 would happen in dec 2021 but idk i honestly think it’s cause tensions were escalating. also ppl could say ww3 hasn’t officially started and this is just a minor skirmish. tbh i browse /x like once every six months to just consider v outlandish ideas and be like that’s a possibility. the coolest one is that there’s a quote in the book of revelations (book in the bible that prophesies the apocalypse) that says “The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many died from the water, because it was made bitter.” chernobyl in ukranian is this black herb that’s sometimes called wormwood and what the bible is prob referring to. prob a coincidence but it’s just an interesting one at the least. idk there’s a lot of interesting conspiracy theories or coincidences and it’s fun thinking about them before the west becomes a dictatorship. this conspiracy is pre anecdotal but there’s a lot of ppl who experiment with psychedelics that see the same shapes and things in there trips..</div><div class="_3-95

at the gym come out at 7 at night, it’s crowded asf and mfs lifting like crazy. ever since my mom started making me food i feel like i need to increase my protein intake. generally tho, i lowkey don’t want to change my diet to much even if it affects my gains. lowkey didn’t do anything when i got home, i’m proud to say i actively watched arthur’s stream today 😎. idk high key just talking about the

i’m happy about my essay i do so shit. honestly i got accepted into ubc and now i can not give two shits about going to school. yk how last post i was like ima have sex in only a serious relationship. on second thought idk bro is deprived of any form of touch 💀. today wasn’t so bad but lying in my bed makes me remember how low i always feel. idk away from my boisterous and loud personality is honestly someone that’s lowkey socially awkward and shy. idk whenever i talk to ori and she’s around her friends i just become so socially awkward. i also feel like whenever i’m at school i just play this persona and then when i get home i just feel like this completely other person. i talk as little as i can and half the time i just end up mourning. idk man it just frustrates me that nobody is able to see my suffering and it just feels like i’m not really myself at school. also ori said she would hang out the sunday after and like high key she’s been ghosting me which is why we haven’t hung out for a long time. honestly idc that much, it’s not like i liked her or thought our relationship could be something i can hold dearly. it kinda hurt bc it just emphasizes how lonely i am and how little value i actually hold to her in the grand scheme of things. and she might cancel our plans. nevertheless i brought it up bc tbh im prob gonna talk about how shit my life is bc she’s the only person i feel remotely comfortable with and i just want someone to care even if she forgot about me for a month 💀. something better then nothing ig. also this one time she gave me head scratches which was weird but felt nice. idk ig ori is just an example of how even tho it’s clear she doesn’t really care about our friendship, i’ll still prob just trauma dump bc everything is trapped inside of me. that thought makes me wanna smoke or die. besides i feel like i’m everyone’s therapist but nobodyIsThereForMe</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

how little i’m lifting but i def am feeling more comfortable in the gym and think less about what others think. feel like the chest i hit yesterday was less about the chest and more about my left arm being super weak. so my chest isn’t that sore. lowkey kept on farting at the end of my workout shit was kinda embarrassing 💀. also think i need to consume more food bc yesterday night my stomach actually hurt sm before i went to bed and i ate two chicken breasts and rice and it felt better. i skipped school today bc tbh i woke up at 6 and was like i had the shittiest day yesterday and 2/3 of my classes are work periods and i’m tired asf so i went back to bed. glad i did bc i woke up at 11 (i slept around 11-12 yesterday so i got a lot of sleep (good for muscle recovery ig) (better for mental state recovery tbh)). maybe i should start counting my calories but i’m too lazy. if you guys didn’t know i was home alone this entire weekend and today too. tbh i took care of my self pretty well, i didn’t cut on my chores or anything. it’s nice being home alone bc i feel comfortable walking around the house, usually when my parents are home i just reside in my room and put that barrier up. been making chicken every meal not bc i’m tryna eat lean meat but bc chicken is the only thing i have. nevertheless still pre good. even tho i skipped school i’ll still prob go to the gym bc what else am i gonna do at home. now only committed mfs have read this far yesterday night was really ass for me tbh. idk i cried for a bit which was nice but idk life really felt like it was crumbling last night. felt and was really down bad. just did some lowkey down bad shit that i won’t get into but it didn’t involve anyone else 👍. idk last night was really bad tbh. idk i just cried and shit and i just never really felt like i was at rock bottom like that for a while. thinking about it makes me feel so ass. honestly feel like the first time ima have sex with someone (ig the second time cause i’m not a virgin) i’m gonna unironically cry or some shit. idk i used to be open to the idea of casual sex but highkey i</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

_a6-i">back hurts so much rn. i don’t wanna be like omgggg i’m so sore bc i’m such a grinder but this is my diary and i can think about is how sore my back is. it’s bc of doms and the only reason it’s this sore is bc i don’t ever use my back muscles and they get really sore the first time you put it under stress. so really me complaining about it being sore goes to show how fat i was. anyways i’m actually going to the gym bc high key, i have nothing to do with my life and it’s the only time where i’m not idle and forget my worries and things like that. i’m not tryna overdo things tho and get burnt out by the third week (like most video games i play) so i’m like lowkey limiting myself. took pre workout today and idk if it helped lifting that much, hard to compare when i don’t have much experience without it. but def helped with my cardio performance, feel like i pushed myself really hard which is good. did shoulders today and the workout kinda seemed ass compared to my other ones. what’s really good is that i didn’t feel completely ass after i caffeine crashed from the pre bc pre has a lot of caffeine. so i’m happy about that. made some more alfredo today and just didn’t do anything in the night. lowkey gym posting a lot but i don’t really do anything during my days other then going to the gym bc at home i don’t even play a lot of video games i just try and kill time. like idk if i was talking to some girl or like actually talking to other ppl i’d post about that but yeah all i do is go to the gym realistically. kind of a sad life but idk it’s hard building relationships when i don’t really like most of the ppl i talk to that much. yesterday i was feeling extremely ass but today i def feel better. trying my best rn. honestly i just want a girl i can cuddle with and feel safe with.never really feel emotionally safe with anybody and i just want someone that can see all my layers and still love me. nevertheless i need to find things i’m passionate about doing so my days are more enjoyable</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202202/FQIoAkMzLBdAJAAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17960199241592216" controls="1"

funny tbh. anyways my arms really fucking sore and i can’t sleep, ig it’s a good thing my arms are sore. it’s good that i’m working out bc now it’s time that will be filled up rather then just time i have open. my parents are gone for the weekend and it’s kinda sad i’m not throwing a rager at my house and prob gonna sit inside and play video games all day. but it’s whatever really. no friends gym arc really happening. this the sigma male arc rn fr. honestly would really want to smoke some weed this weekend but i’m too lazy to get a plug to buy it for me. gonna actually buy protein powder bc it’s impossible to reach the amount of protein required by actually eating food. also prob buy preworkout just to be more focused. lowkey don’t want to use it bc it’s like 3 servings of coffee in one

is so fucking ass rn. like genuinely so ass. idk how to save my mental health rn no lie. so lost in life. swear god hates me, life  has been pain for so long. i’ve regressed so much it’s sad. like idk my mental health is just gone now and all my progress seems to be wasted. feel like i’m in the same spot i was a year ago. maybe even worse idek. honestly feel like i’m gonna attempt again. but highkey i have this promise with myself that if i’m gonna attempt again i’ll be successful so ig that’s what’s stopping me rn. idk man. i genuinely don’t feel like i was designed to live. i just dk if ill ever be happy and being happy is just harder for me i feel like. maybe i was never supposed to live? never been lonelier nowadays, feel like this past year i’ve isolated myself from every relationship. if i died tmmrw it wouldn’t matter too much to many ppl. which is okay ig to me. the only thought positive in my mind is that bc i have nothing to lose i have everything to gain. but having nothing is so fucking painful, i might as well be dead. idk i feel like i wake up and i suffer. i just wanna be happy. i just want someone that i actually care about. i just wanna be someone. i don’t have anyone. i’m just so chronically alone. i’m so weak.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202202/AF4A3441582584193E61B49325506083_video_dashinit_17966284672545734.mp4"

state is an all time low. tbh valentine’s day didn’t upset that much but after my therapy session i was actually super triggered and upset. shit was fucking brain dead. i’m so lonely tbh. i feel like i’m used to seeing couples that it doesn’t make me upset but when i think about my day to day life i just realize life is genuinely shit. my therapist is really trying to push me to do new things like classes for my hobbies or things like that to meet new ppl bc the relationships i’ve had in hs aren’t what i’m looking for. for some reason i can’t get myself to do it, ik i should and ill try but idk i just really emotionally can’t do it. which is weird ig. a part of is idk what i want to do and idk it’s just weird ig. also kinda related but my therapist was like in uni i can see you talking to ppl older then you. and idk if talking to hs ppl isn’t working that means i’m gonna talk to uni students or even older 💀. what if i meet a milf that i can unironically call mommy⁉️⁉️⁉️ idk it just feels weird talking to ppl that won’t be in hs. idk why. but yeah i’m gonna find the willpower to do something like sign up for a class. it’s really weird how i really don’t wanna do it. all i’m thinking about rn is what age is it weird for me to be friends with. it’s just weird in genera, can’t imagine myself being friends with an adult 💀. then again i talk to my therapist every week and i’d say we get along. honestly it sucks that this is the only thing i can do to improve the circumstances of my life, i really wish i could just branch out to ppl in hs but it never has worked. i can’t get this age thing out of my head, what if i dated someone over the age of my sister 💀. k idk why i’m thinking about this age thing but ever since my therapist said ill prob be friends with that are older im like yeah probably and then weirded out at the same time. really lost in life and don’t have the motivation for much. i wanna kms</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

it must be right!!! anyways life is pre dog shit rn. this is like my first therapy session in a month where i actually just feel shitty about my life. it’s hard to say how i feel but it’s just the common theme about how i feel alone. i basically never open up to anyone anymore. tbh i listen to other ppl a lot more and idm doing it. i just feel lonely bc i never open up or say anything. idk i feel like i’ve said all this a million times on her and i’m beating a dead horse. was gonna drink tn but i didn’t ig. took a 3 hour nap bc i slept at 1 last night and woke up at 6. idek what to say anymore. ig i will continue living my shitty life. go to two ib classes that i enjoy but still not that fun, go to my two dash one classes that bore me out of my mind, go home and nap and do hw and do the one thing that i find fun and play factorio. i’ll continue talking to the people ik casually and if we stop talking i won’t care cause i never invested anything anyways. i’ll still yearn to have a relationship where i actually feel heard and understood but will never get it. i’ll talk to a new girl every 4 months where i think i might have a meaningful friendship with, only to find out that nothing will or would’ve happened. i just find out i invested my time into nothing. and then im alone again. at least factorio is fun</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

sleep (which means lying in bed on my phone for two hours with the lights off 💀). sometimes i be talking about girls about there issues and i just wanna *ahem* become yassified and just start spitting some cringe like girlboss to hype them up. it’s like the guys equivalent of like “nah focus on yourself bro, these hoes ain’t shit” but in the girl translation. like omg yass queen you don’t need him to slayyyyyy. k just threw up in my mouth. feel like a home wrecker cause i talk to girls to breakup with there mans bc of issues. every time im like imo this a dealbreaker. i was like why don’t i tell guys to breakup with their girl? then i realize i talk to guys that get no bitches 💀. y’all guys really need to get some bitches. not me tho im down to be an incel and playing factorio. today was a day of actually taking care of self. cleaned my keyboard and mousepad (shit was so disgusting) cleaned my toilet and shit and went out with this girl. lowkey feel like i was flexing how i’m happy now bc i embraced the fact that i sit on my ass and play video games. “no trust me 10 hours of factorio a day makes me really happy!!!” “i have the music taste where i scare the hoes but trust me i don’t need hoes if i enjoy my music taste!!” 🤓🤓. genuinely does tho lol. then i was like bro trust me drop your bf (it’s okay she agrees with me and all her friends do so i’m not an homewrecker!!!(pls trust me you can do sm better queen there’s so many better men like me and you don’t need him i can treat you better i’m such a good guy i would never do that if i was him i would treat you like a queen bro trust me i don’t want you to breakup bc i want to hit)) okay too much metaposting it’s making me look like i wanna hit but i’m too good to do it (this sentence creates an infinite loop of metaposting where the only outcome is i want to hit). too self aware about the implications of my actions and sentences tbh. also defending yourself is genuinely hard thing to do, accusing ppl way too fun and too easy to do in comparison. this post has gone totally off the rails. i think the point of the post is that.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

music taste 💀. i have way too much energy and it’s 1:30. also i feel like music taste low key devolved, i’m starting to kinda fuck with music that sounds like it came from some local ass soundcloud rapper 💀. anyways as usual nothing to say.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202201/FQIoAkMzLBdAKogxJul41RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17907247079457812" controls="1"

_a6-i">2am posts cause i can’t sleep. it’s so weird how i’m not depressed anymore i can’t lie. i feel like everything is the same except for the fact that i don’t wanna die and i just kinda accept things. like my relationship with my parents is still super awkward and i literally try to say as little as i can to them. yet i don’t feel so shitty about it. or i still kinda yearn for a romantic relationship but there’s not that pressure to get into one immediately nor the feeling that my life is empty asf without one. and i’m somehow super okay with having no friends or with some of my friends not liking that much. i also don’t feel so shitty about constantly changing my hobbies, i just beat enter the gungeon today and i’m pretty happy about that. can’t wait to play a couple more play throughs. tbh there’s just a lot more acceptance in my life which first is off putting bc i don’t want to ever accept a version of me that is lacking. but there’s a lot of realization that friends i make rn will honestly be temporary bc there’s definitely a lack of depthness (and i’m not an asshole for not having any friends), constantly changing hobbies is prob a symptom of my adhd (and if i’m not enjoying smth there’s no shame of dropping it), the emotions and relationship i feel around my parents are not in my control and a romantic relationship will come and i’m fine with just doing things i enjoy. honestly the relationships i have with everyone on this spam will prob be irrelevant but i honestly feel completely okay. like obviously there was aspirations that i would’ve had these friendships forever but at the same time there’s this huge acceptance piece that we’ve grown to different people. another huge acceptance piece is just with world news. sometimes i feel really shitty about where the world is going: climate change, inflation and unliveable cost of living and there’s a lot of scholars saying that america’s democracy will end in 10
years (which i don’t believe but it’s a testament to how shit america is doing). i am helpless to this but honestly i feel like it feels better to feel helpless bc i’m just able to accept that yeah my future might be unstable but there’s nothing i can..</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202201/FQIoAkMzLBdAJ1T987ZFohgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17927404421071007"

at the end of the day. so i’m bouta just sit on the toilet for half a hour making this spam post. i’m prob gonna call out some ppl on this spam here (including myself) but idk how ppl just feel okay about what they know is the wrong thing. like i did it in the past but it just feels so weird to do it now. i was talking to this girl and she’s basically like thinging with this guy. but the guy confessed feelings and she lied and said she had feelings back. i just told her this will blow up in your face and she’s like yeah ik and i just didn’t say anything more bc ik she won’t be receptive to anything i say. just a huge turnoff idk. is it really that hard to just be like yeah i don’t really feel like hooking up or talking to you anymore and just have a friends with benefits with someone else. and she also decided to move her therapy session and idk i don’t fuck with it. i just hate when ppl realize there flaws and don’t do anything to fix them. or just don’t have a desire to be any better or genuinely think about themselves or their actions in an objective manner. plus it’s just annoying seeing someone actively hurt others and basically not having anyone to say there a piece of shit. this other girl was telling me how she broke up with her bf and they are still really close and that they’ll prob hookup. she’s like yeah it’s really awkward and it’s really bad that i’m doing this and this is all my fault, but i’m gonna continue. idk you’re just delaying the healing process for both parties yet you don’t really care and continue. idk i can’t stand that type of shit. it just makes me depressed that ppl are willing to do the wrong thing and end up making things worse for themselves and others. honestly past me would really try to change their perspective and do the right thing, but i’ve genuinely learned that saying what i truly think is just so brain dead bc some ppl will just never be receptive towards what i say. genuinely, i’m not down to help ppl who don’t and won’t help themselves. i genuinely want to build meaningful relationships but there’s just so many ppl that are…</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

actually pulling emily apparently and they’ve hung out together a lot. but during chem this guy was like begging me to play val with him and carry him cause he is unironically iron 1. and i told nah i don’t really want to. and he’s like trust me bro i’m really good check my match history my teammates are just shit. he’s like every game my teammates are so brain dead. i tell him no but later today i was like fuck it i wanna learn sova i’ll just smurf in iron 1. and this guy was actually shit, i dropped 35 and he dropped like 5. i didn’t care that much bc whatever i’m smurfing. but then i check his match history and he’s actually piss shit. hes went negative like 12/15 games and basically never carries and never influences the game. like having a bad kd is fine, i’m like 75% wr with like a 0.85 kd which is embarrassing but i’ve been solo queuing this season (tbf i’ve gotten kinda lucky). but like i don’t say  i’m hard carrying my games. idk this guy legit just fucking lied to me in front of my face and was like bro trust i don’t deserve iron 1 i was bronze 2 last act. this guy had the audacity to say check his match history betting that we wouldn’t. it doesn’t annoy me that much

legendary. anyways i’m here to say i hate school but in the best place i’ve been mentally for a while. like idk life ain’t so bad rn. i need a job tho cause now i wanna buy crazy amounts of clothes. but i’ve been just the best place mentally which is super nice. only think about suicide maybe once or twice a week. lowkey the biggest change for my mental health was just saying fuck it and doing things i enjoy just bc. like i don’t really question the purpose anymore and i will always end up doing things i actually enjoy doing. like when i play video games i’m actually having fun. second thing is genuinely prioritizing myself and like lowkey not caring about anyone else ngl. i’ve realized that in the past i’m pre overbearing bc i wanna care about ppl and receive that care back but that rarely ever happens. i used to force intimacy a lot just cause i was really lonely. but lately i’ve been really enjoying spending my time alone. and just being myself and shit. i feel like i’m kinda turning my back on ppl who are also depressed by just prioritizing myself but idk. sometimes i’m just like i don’t wanna deal with this and i end up don’t. and it’s pre freeing. like i allow myself to not care about anybody which is nice. hopefully i do end up caring about someone but that will just come with time. i’ll find someone. for now i’m enjoying my life and mentally i feel really good.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202201/D74147CB1EDA427C53D48CFDD7D54A9B_video_dashinit_18021996172344022.mp4" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank"

to this kinda party but low key didn’t want to figure out a ride back and i didn’t know anybody there. feel like i’d end up just getting drunk by myself and that would be awkward. tbh don’t regret playing rotmg for my new year,,, idk it’s fun and i’m starting to feel more ingrained into the community which is nice. don’t have any resolution bc 1. i don’t really believe in it cause if you’re actually gonna commit to a goal it’s not bc it’s a new year and 2. i kinda wanna just take day by day. see what i wanna become by the day ig. even tho playing video games feels so inc and meaningless, i’ve been having a lot of fun this winter break and tbh haven’t been stressed at all,, i’d even say this is the least stressed i’ve been for a while. usually with relationships or friends i feel like i always end up stressing a lot about them (esp when i relied on them a lot for my mental health) but now since i’m doing my own thing and playing my own video games, i feel like i can do things more on my own terms which is nice. tbh i’ve been really enjoying alone time which is strange bc i would categorize myself as an extrovert who low key constantly needs attention. ppl saying happy new years makes me wanna cry for some reason tho idk. realistically im pretty alone but im just tryna take it one day at a time. im pre tired rn. happy new year again &lt;3</div><div class="_3-95

do. so i wanted to go mountain skating with my friends and i drove all the way to banff but all the lakes were filled with snow so we ended up just going to this small rink in banff and skating. i honestly felt really bad bc i wasted like two hours of everyone’s time bc i decided to drag everyone to banff instead of skating inside of calgary. along with that i was really late (which wasn’t my fault) but idk i just felt like i wasted everybody’s time. which brings me back to my dad. high key this guy does not know how to account for what other ppl want to do and expects that what he enjoys is what everyone will. but my dad is willing to sacrifice a lot of his time and money to do something together that he thinks we will all enjoy. but when we end up not having that much fun (which we always do) he prob feels like shit cause he wasted everyone’s time. and idk i just realized how shitty he felt. also i ran a red light today bc it was so fucking icy and i didn’t want to stop and i’m so mad about it. it flashed my car when i ran it but i might’ve not got caught cause there was sm snow covering my license plate. generally i’m really tired and down to sleep rn. this winter break has been really good and i had a lot fun!! i honestly forget what it’s like to have strict parents with high expectations and feel like i could’ve accommodated better to my friends with strict parents. a big problem of mine is i don’t gaf and my parents don’t but it kinda makes me do things which inadvertently fucks ppl over. idk maybe in tryna accommodate too much but i feel pretty inconsiderate. i’m tired i’ll think about this tmmrw</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202112/FQIoAkMzLBdAK92yLQ5WBBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17935741186855855" controls="1"

culture but idk Christmas also makes me happy bc it&#039;s so wholesome. on a sidenote I was getting in my feels in my car but honestly I&#039;m having a lot of fun this winter break and I forget about a lot of stuff. idk I&#039;m just happy that&#039;s it&#039;s Christmas and happy that y&#039;all were in my life at one point of my life. that&#039;s pretty cool. honestly not as close with most of you anymore but I feel like that&#039;s just bc I&#039;ve changed so much over the past year that our relationship suffers ig. which really sucks that were not as close as before but idk I still find it really nice that I was a part of your lives at one point and you all are on here bc I really appreciated you and still do. I don&#039;t regret any of our relationship tbh and it sucks that I&#039;ve changed. I don&#039;t want to mention this cause it takes away from the appreciation but lowkey the relationship I kinda regret is with grace. my sister said it was toxic and I was kinda reluctant to agree but genuinely that relationship was toxic. I gotta stop romanticizing my past with her, she was a huge support in my life but that support was so conditional. idk the insecurities that she would leave me were honestly really valid and not bc I was depressed. and I just think I gotta face the truth and admit that our relationship was really toxic and lowkey grace was really toxic. that genuinely hurts to say lowkey. speaking of relationships, I feel like relationships gives security in favor of freedom and character development tbh. In my experience you become so stagnant with a relationship while being single is so turbulent. I could never imagine myself changing sm if I was still dating angel and I&#039;m kinda glad I broke up with her now that I look back. the problem is you can&#039;t be single forever bc you develop character for nobody. so when do you invest in a relationship? also maybe me and angel were too intertwined to the point where I wouldn&#039;t change. i don&#039;t wanna be alone tho. I feel like a lot of ppl are in relationship for the sake of being a relationship. I wanna find someone that I actually really like for their character and personality. the</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202112/FQIoAkMzLBdAJSHKwIMSbxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17938841545805391" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202112/FQIoAkMzLBdAJSHKwIMSbxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17938841545805391"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202112/270012930_381717930396475_103884737667880705_n_18254865316070005.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202112/269831042_1118895338647656_3242507403743307701_n_17904584783467934.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202112/269831042_1118895338647656_3242507403743307701_n_17904584783467934.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Dec 25, 2021, 2:01 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">just been reflecting on my winter break and it sounds Uber shit but Im actually enjoying myself. ngl all I do is play rotmg, league or terraria but I&#039;m genuinely having a lot of fun doing those things. like usually when I spend too long playing a game I just get depressed cause I have no friends but idk I&#039;m enjoying myself. maybe it&#039;s bc I&#039;m playing with other ppl but I&#039;m genuinely enjoying myself when I&#039;m alone. tbh I rather play alone sometimes just cause rotmg is that fun. along with that I used to never be the one to leave my friend to go to bed or like call it a day but recently I&#039;ve been doing it a lot. and idk that&#039;s really different cause I&#039;ve never done it.

I respect that she doesn&#039;t care tho and that as long as I get a good grade I can do anything I want. lowkey love my chem teacher.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202112/262468546_965530123999929_6081859503382470340_n_18145897924212593.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202112/262468546_965530123999929_6081859503382470340_n_18145897924212593.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202112/262929227_448649523270036_240115927481594046_n_17922930073995321.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202112/262929227_448649523270036_240115927481594046_n_17922930073995321.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202112/262370212_268543758632862_9085212394230284663_n_17904730376486108.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202112/262370212_268543758632862_9085212394230284663_n_17904730376486108.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202112/262892401_300420238633942_6427557911678342915_n_17944245658653134.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202112/262892401_300420238633942_6427557911678342915_n_17944245658653134.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Dec 1, 2021, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">got to gold in tft and I feel so good at the game so fast. fucking hyped. also popped off today, got two firsts and a second and my firsts weren&#039;t kat. anyways handed in my ubc and it&#039;s kinda ass but whatever. hopefully I actually get in ig. also lowkey ass at texting cause I accidentally sent some shit that I didn&#039;t mean at all. uhhh fuck nervous asf rn. whatever ig. umm I&#039;ll try to go to bed</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202111/262220582_317099320038017_2871878078350844402_n_17946195973623744.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202111/262220582_317099320038017_2871878078350844402_n_17946195973623744.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202111/261944845_321684459525128_4901775762743364159_n_18138297019219213.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202111/261944845_321684459525128_4901775762743364159_n_18138297019219213.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Nov 30, 2021, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">honestly the last couple of years I really didn&#039;t fuck with Virgil abloh and honestly think other then has first two collections in Louis, they&#039;ve all been ass but I still was kinda sad that this guy died. kinda in shock too cause it was so unexpected. like he represents a big part of Hypebeast culture but honestly I have a lot of respect for this guy looking back at his career. tbh he&#039;s one of the first ppl to get me into fashion, prob the first designer i knew the name of. and the off-white x Nike Collab is literally the most revolutionary Collab of all time tbh.

I also force relationships lowkey just bc I have a glimmer of hope which is dumb. ppl complimented the hair which was fucking dope. made me fucking happy as shit. went to my therapist and ranted about what I&#039;m gonna say next. generally I just feel like I don&#039;t really exist. physically I do but realistically I don&#039;t. because nobody really knows me like grace once knew me. and I don&#039;t miss her but it is genuinely sad that how I don&#039;t have anybody close to me. bc now I have a fuck ton of ppl that know me but nobody that understands me or that I have impacted in a significant way. without that I don&#039;t feel like I exist. bc ppl percieve me but nobody actually sees me. obv completely understanding somebody is impossible but nobody has reached a level of intimacy with me where I feel like they actually understand me. tbh every interaction I have with ppl just make me realize how different I am. if I died rn, my funeral wouldnt have anybody that actually know me. people would be sad but it would just bc they lost this idea of me. honestly I just yearn to be close with someone again. I overcompensate a lot too for that. but I just want to actually exist to someone and not be a perception. I want to exist with someone and be independent but actually exist to each other. I feel like I&#039;m trying to sound really smart here explaining a basic idea and im cringing. but idk I don&#039;t exist at all rn. and I&#039;m not really living either. I feel like I&#039;m always living for the future. sure ik what I want from a relationship but I never get a genuine human connection. everybody I talk to is emotionally unavailable for a relationship that I want or we&#039;re just different people.

I hope I&#039;m wrong but I just doubt this girl has the capacity to love me the way I want. just the vibe I&#039;m getting. whatever hopefully she has time this weekend to go out. bruh I&#039;m talking about her too much she fr living in my head rent free. and I don&#039;t even like her just the idea</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/246117713_1333404960434136_7150718502875356641_n_17966766250461733.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202110/246117713_1333404960434136_7150718502875356641_n_17966766250461733.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/246006814_606127714002811_4540854198001791451_n_17974984663438961.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202110/246006814_606127714002811_4540854198001791451_n_17974984663438961.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Oct 15, 2021, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">mf medina pisses me off. we were doing this group project with 5 ppl and this mf was bitching the entire time I genuinely want her to shut up. like I&#039;m just tryna get the project done and she complaining about how it don&#039;t look nice and I&#039;m like mf you don&#039;t even know shit were talking about. so fucking annoying. and she&#039;s like picking arguments with me too it&#039;s so cringe. can&#039;t handle her tbh. but ive been chill with everyone abd making new friends. can&#039;t get over how annoying she is tho. mf needs to shut up. that&#039;s all. everything else is fine tbh. prob gonna drop from g2.

I can&#039;t fucking stand this guy. my mom had to esxort this mf away cause he wouldn&#039;t leave to. shit is ironic too cause she did the same thing today. she came in my room and cried (shit annoys me to cause like now I gotta comfort you instead of you being there for me like you pretend to do) and I ended up having this dumbass conversation for like 20 minutes where she ignores my wishes and does what she thinks I want her to do and I spend all the time in the world telling her that she&#039;s a dumbass cause she thinks not leaving my room will make me feel supported and that doing this does nothing for her expect make me hate her and feel alone. I get she feels lonely but she a whole ass adult go deal with those emotions without involving me. the main reason she did was not because she cared for me rather because she felt hopeless and wanted to have a sense of control. so essentially she just did all of this for herself rather then for me and she did it to control me. fucking annoys me man. sure she is ignorant to the fact but my entire life my parents have been fucking ignorant to everything. sure I get the argument that ppl rather pretend their happy then face the truth. ultimately tho, somebody unproportionally suffers a greater amount from ignorance. if life is objectively not worth living you&#039;re suffering an unproportional amount by deciding to be ignorant. if the only way life is worth living is to be ignorant about the fact that life is not worth living</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202110/FQIoAkMzLBdAQC7ZFocrAhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18129428602219075" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/FQIoAkMzLBdAQC7ZFocrAhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18129428602219075"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/243583038_757191225145098_5708014575390731701_n_17954920066502683.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202110/FQIoAkMzLBdAIpmZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17937111334654092" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/FQIoAkMzLBdAIpmZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17937111334654092"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202110/FQIoAkMzLBdAKwAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18144675388201798" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/FQIoAkMzLBdAKwAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18144675388201798"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/244189392_575299797028029_3654026313147005889_n_17897178326224404.webp"><img src="media/posts/202110/244189392_575299797028029_3654026313147005889_n_17897178326224404.webp" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/244041470_907296523502961_6745020081217657350_n_17912444419967895.webp"><img src="media/posts/202110/244041470_907296523502961_6745020081217657350_n_17912444419967895.webp" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/243881035_556633535550661_2322373041317589604_n_17926310044839356.webp"><img src="media/posts/202110/243881035_556633535550661_2322373041317589604_n_17926310044839356.webp" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/244352100_891393988475969_8073659227072845561_n_17914749829907084.webp"><img src="media/posts/202110/244352100_891393988475969_8073659227072845561_n_17914749829907084.webp" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202110/FQIoAkMzLBdAJAAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17934639388678171" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/FQIoAkMzLBdAJAAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17934639388678171"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202110/244469699_618202635838166_6433688422158987522_n_18129128539241869.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Oct 2, 2021, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">didn&#039;t do much today escept read berserk and I went out with varjn. for some reason I was feeling really confident and wanted to ask for a girls number but I ended up not doing it. played val and has fun but it&#039;s cause I&#039;m winning so much. literally haven&#039;t lost in like 3 days and im wondering how that&#039;s gonna feel. crazy how the one person that actively reaches out to me is a person I don&#039;t really like. been indulging myself with boring convos with a lot of ppl ngl. don&#039;t feel like going to school tmmrw but whatever. ashamed asf about my English grade no cap. just don&#039;t want to go to school. any type of failure fucks me up so much it&#039;s actually not good. ass asf at handling failure. and not to blame things I can&#039;t control but it&#039;s genuinely just my depression and shit. shits ass asf. single and lonely asf. but I mean whatever. ngl I feel like I just don&#039;t have a place to return.

naturally it brings less joy and it&#039;s harder to be motivated. and like tbh I&#039;ve quit skating, league and badminton for all the same reasons. idk my mental is just so shit and it&#039;s

is so ass and that&#039;s why I&#039;m stagnating in s3 and kinda hardstuck. finished vagabond today and didn&#039;t think it was exceptional but I def feel like I missed out on a lot of the nuance in the novel and the character development. I give it like a 7.5. all the accounts I follow praise that shit so highly tho. but it&#039;s really given me a perspective on what strength is and humanity&#039;s connection to nature. also wasted two hours arguing with somebody that doesn&#039;t believe in climate change. I&#039;ll never get those two hours back. tbh I&#039;m actually gonna stop arguing with people humanity is just too stubborn on their beliefs. I mean cause she works in oil and gas I&#039;d low-key make her question her whole life. tbh people gotta question their whole life more no cap. actually talked with my dad and he just said he was in his anger management classes and he apologized for what he did with his anger and admitted it was wrong and that he tried to make me live out his dream by being good at badminton. but tbh it just seemed really authentic because he wasn&#039;t like emotional but just genuinely telling me and naming the things he did wrong. it&#039;s honestly a really big step for him and idk because of that I do feel closer to him. it really means a lot tbh. and he said all he had was his family but he pushed a lot of us away but he wants me to get better for myself and not him and that means a lot. and he was just telling me how he had no friends and highschool cause he spoke a different dialect and it was nice hearing his experience. like he was being vulnerable and just admitting that yeah his grades and atheltics were good but he had no friends and literally never talked to a girl. and just admitting that weakness feels like a big step for him. and idk because of that I have prospects for the future. in general he&#039;s been better. so maybe things will get better with my family. tbh I kinda hate when ppl cry when they apologize or are really emotional cause it&#039;s almost like they&#039;re begging for pity and</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdAQeZmZmZmZhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18163673338166868" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdAQeZmZmZmZhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18163673338166868"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/242873863_4349843438433024_7220127804216333819_n_17886844079352155.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdANBmZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18234053242072382" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdANBmZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18234053242072382"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Sep 26, 2021, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">I make a positive post and ig decided not to post it so here we go again. thrift haul post!!! copped two blazers, the golf shirt and the brown pants for $35. also stole two books on top of that. only posting to show off the haul cause I feel kinda sexy no cap. my fav pieces from the haul is the shirt and the pants. but maybe it&#039;s cause idk how to style blazers yet. gonna think about it and search up inspo and see how yohji Yamamoto uses his blazers. the pants are size 38 waist but I make them work but they are huge. thrifitng by myself yesterday was fun and Im gonna do it more because I&#039;ve realized how important fashion is and it&#039;s something I genuinely like doing. I might not be amazing but it made me happy to thrift and to take fit pics.

I&#039;m better now but still it&#039;s braindead how tilted I can get shits annoying. me and grace are getting a lot closer and it&#039;s nice. I don&#039;t feel uncomfortable around her and I&#039;m fine with the idea of her having a bf. and we just shit talk people and make braindead jokes and it&#039;s fun. it&#039;s honestly nice. it sucks that she has a bf tho so we&#039;ll prob never hang out outside of school :/. I honestly had a pretty good day at school, it&#039;s just the small interactions that count imo. but they really do brighten my day. and I do enjoy English and I like Hamlet and annotating the shit out of it. every page is filled to the brim with my writing and it&#039;s nice having a really good understanding of a Shakespeare text. also I love hamlet&#039;s first soliloquy and people were roasting me for it. but if I could write that well I feel like people could understand how I feel on my spam posts so much better because it&#039;s just so beautiful and idk. I love this quote when I first read Hamlet but &quot;O, that this too too sullied flesh would melt // Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew&quot; is just such a fire fucking line. I even have memorized this shit. it makes me wanna read midsummer night dream this weekend and annotate a lot of it. I&#039;m getting really bored of my style and I have no friends so I&#039;m just gonna go thrifitng by myself. I want to dress more wildly, probably look at the female section more and honestly just to stop dressing so normal. it sucks cause me and grace wanna thrift together but it&#039;ll be hard with her bf. and like that&#039;d be fine other than the fact I have no friends. in general I just play third wheel to a lot of girls relationships. some mfs would call me down bad but I don&#039;t mind. like I am down bad but I also just value our friendship and it&#039;s not like I previously liked them (except grace). but it&#039;s pretty depressing to think about tbh. and if a mf notices it I&#039;ll prob get roasted. tbh it&#039;s at the point where I&#039;m not excited for the weekend cause I have nothing to do. maybe I&#039;ll start watching anime idk. I just know for the majority of the weekend I&#039;ll just wanna cry.

I was talking with grace today and she told me talked to me Amina and she mentioned me and was like did he say anything bad about me on his spam. ofc she doesn&#039;t know and she told Amina but still. and I saw carol and Kai in the halls and they said hi to me and I waved back but ig nobody saw cause (I was walking with medina) medina was like why don&#039;t you wave back and Carol kinda passively agressively said like yeah carsyn wave back. tbh idk why I&#039;m talking about these people, I genuinely don&#039;t care. I guess it goes both ways tho, they wonder what I think about them and they wonder what they think about me. not my fault they ghosted me tho tbh. tbh if they asked me to be friends with them again I&#039;d probably say no. even tho I&#039;m super lonely and have no friends. maybe I just have too much integrity or smth I have no clue. this pain is like self inflicted. nowadays school just makes me so upset that I just go home and nap till like 9 just to forget about my problems. maybe medina does just see thru me and knows that I&#039;m actually depressed. but she probably just assumes cause I told her I go to therapy. either way I&#039;m not being vulnerable to her. she fucking annoys me.

I was in my car today in the morning and I cried a bit. I slept from like 6-11. tbh waking up I just feel despair. I was feeling melancholic all day. there are some highlights, I talked with grace like old times and connected with my friends in general. those are my highlights tho, small talk are my highlights. kinda sad ig. I&#039;m ngl I&#039;m a lot less depressed this year but suicide seems more of a genuine option. I used to have hope that my family would work out bit every ounce of that hope is gone. I&#039;ve gine thru so many friendships that I just want to give up on making friends. I&#039;ve realized how shitty humans really are and how everything is so cylical.

it&#039;s genuinely so embarrassing how much this guy needs female validation. I remember when he used to talk mad shit about weilan and now they&#039;re besties. and like tbh I&#039;m not mad that weilan probably knows all the shit I said behind her back, it&#039;s just so fucking annoying that he has no authenticity and decided to become friends with weilan. like it&#039;s not my problem and it doesn&#039;t affect me, but it&#039;s just so embarrassing. he genuinely tries so hard to be validated by the opposite gender. and I feel like his looks nowadays have literally been molded by weilan and he just has no originality. like there&#039;s really people that just only care what females think of them. ig he really is a pick me guy. shit annoys me.

therapy jusf make me feel like shit tbh. it&#039;s good to get it out but I&#039;m fr done with a lot of shit in my life and I&#039;m just ready to give up tbh. I don&#039;t want to find new friends and I&#039;m sick of tired of opening myself up to mfs. every single relationship has always ended and I&#039;m not tryna repeat the pain. I&#039;m so done bruh so done with this shit. life is so fucking unfsir ig. grace gets to have her close friends and her bf while I sit here lost and struggling keeping people. fuck me man. I fucking hate this shit tbh. shit genuinely makes me wanna shoot myself I&#039;m not even joking. I can get my day to day but when I realize how lonely I am I wish I wasn&#039;t alive. and shit hurts. I&#039;ve been thinking about joining some type of club or some shit for reading cause I need motivation to read and I just need to find friends. shits sad asf tho. mfs be saying things will get better, they didn&#039;t. I can&#039;t even open myself up to a relationship anymore. I just wanna give up. I pretend I&#039;m better then mfs but I&#039;m at my lowest. and honestly I just hate humanity. like what a dog shit species tbh. I&#039;m not gonna amount to shit either. like I have these dreams but I&#039;m sure one day I&#039;ll be put back into reality and realize how unreasonable these dreams are. I just want friends tbh.

I mean it&#039;s only temporary that I&#039;m deciding to slave myself. lowkey if I don&#039;t get the job I might just not apply to other places cause I&#039;m just very split on what to do tbh. but highkey I decided to slave myself cause I&#039;ve just given up on making meaningful connextjons this year. which is sad ig. it&#039;s sad that the people that I want to talk to are busy and the people I don&#039;t want to talk to actively go out there way to talk to me (my family and medina). ig I&#039;m just cringe. I mean a big thing I&#039;ve realized with medina that I&#039;ve always just believed in is that getting girls or attentjon from the opposite gender just doesn&#039;t fulfill me. it almost repulses me tbh. a big part of me is just kinda sad too because she probably only likes the idea of me. she likes that I&#039;m an &quot;art kid&quot; (she always calls me that) that I dress well (she probably only likes me because of that) and that I don&#039;t give af (opposites attract ig). and that makes me feel more lonely tbh. I think generally I could be very popular if I just played a persona (which I&#039;ve played in grade 10 and I&#039;m pretty good at it) but idk I care so much about authenticity that I just don&#039;t. I feel like I&#039;m definitely ostracizing myself but idk I just want to give up on having relationships. so much pain has been brought upon me thru relationships that I&#039;m just kinda done. honestly maybe I just throw away my mortality and just live life unapologetically selfishly and then kms when I face the consequences. tbh I&#039;d never do that I probably just kms instead. humans are dog shit anyways tbh. if I can&#039;t beat the evil I might as well join it</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdAKDMzMzMzMxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17858388452608730" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdAKDMzMzMzMxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17858388452608730"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/241848337_261675825677515_672164796258882128_n_18008941498340865.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdANu7ZFocrAhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17901331076235589" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdANu7ZFocrAhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17901331076235589"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/241878298_930196784235871_551429251762299447_n_17918534053905438.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Sep 11, 2021, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">no memes to post so I blessed y&#039;all souls with a picture of the sexiest man alive. anyways I decided I&#039;ma get a job because I have nothing to do everyday and I&#039;ve decided the best way to alievate my pain is to grind a job I&#039;m probably gonna hate so I can cope with consumerism. lowkey gonna grind to asked for 20 hours which is kinda braindead maybe I asked for too much fjck it.

I told grace this and shes like positive she&#039;s into me. but I&#039;m like bruh what if this woman is just like this or some shit. no cap tho the flirting making me kinds infatuated cause I be a hopeless romantic and shit and she probably like the first woman to hit on me. and idk she specifically gives me so much attention and like wants to be my friend. idk bro. socials kinda enjoyable tho no cap cause it&#039;s fun getting hit on. tbh I&#039;ve never gotten hit on in my life and idek if I am now but I have no idea how to react no cap.

I feel like if I didn&#039;t look so cold and act so cold more girls would hit on me but I&#039;m not tryna change parts of me to get girls. maybe she just friendly or playing me. idk</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/241302383_356528752670475_4950949283614353231_n_17940926065588451.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202109/241302383_356528752670475_4950949283614353231_n_17940926065588451.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Device ID</div><div><div class="_a6-q">android-f6b6a001e7c55ba2</div></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Source type</div><div><div class="_a6-q">ANDROID_GALLERY</div></div></td></tr></table><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Has Camera Metadata</div><div><div class="_a6-q"></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Sep 8, 2021, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">horny posting on main story cap. medina lowkey annoying me. social fr borng asf I just be in there doing nothing and leaning nothing . can&#039;t even read in that mf class. but chem I be reading and shit and it be nice. optimizing school so I can read. played CSGO and val today with arthur and Cs is so brsidesd it&#039;s actually fun. and I&#039;m pretty happy to end this act s3. got no friends but I be gwming and it&#039;s fun. bruh I can&#039;t stop shitpostinf shit gets me no friends. but it&#039;s so fun to just be braindead. mad mfs prob hate me lol.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video src="media/posts/202109/9D4BA26B7F90C2E3EC12E7E22639DE8E_video_dashinit_17894959430197841.mp4" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/9D4BA26B7F90C2E3EC12E7E22639DE8E_video_dashinit_17894959430197841.mp4"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Device ID</div><div><div class="_a6-q">android-f6b6a001e7c55ba2</div></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Date taken</div><div><div class="_a6-q">19040101T000000.000Z</div></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Source type</div><div><div class="_a6-q">4</div></div></td></tr></table><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Has Camera Metadata</div><div><div class="_a6-q"></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Sep 7, 2021, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">we hit fucking silver 3. didn&#039;t do shit today except play val and I hit silver 3. basically climbed a whole division this act so I&#039;m actually hyped with my improvement. hype asf. other than that I&#039;m not hyped for school. everything fr giving me anxiety and shit. it&#039;s actually bad. really shit at sleeping slept at like 3:30 last night. thinking about it it was like a manic episode (exagerration) cause I was on some crazy shit. like idk bro. and then at the very I got very depressed about shit in my life and grace lmao.

I feel like I&#039;m so demanding with my relationships. but idk I just need so much of other people to function. I&#039;ve been reading a lot of plato and ancient Greeks were genuinely gay asf it&#039;s crazy. but other then that I believe that he introduces an idea that at the end of the day most our meaning is to reach a state of immortality. for example he says the root of sexual desire and procreation is to become immortal cause you pass down parts of yourself. another aspect of becoming immortal is influencing people and helping them become a better person because you&#039;re permanently changing someone and that changed person will influence a lot more. and this philosophy makes sense. it seems like a philosophy that is derived from human nature. the problem is in the modern context this philosophy sucks cock. cause global warming is getting out of hand and generally I believe that the world will end pretty soon. I could make arguments on why but I&#039;m too lazy. that&#039;s for another post .and because of that this philosophy doesn&#039;t mean shit in the modern context. so it&#039;s hard to live when (I feel like the most natural reason to live as it explains why we value procreation) does not work in a modern context. it makes life feel so temporary. and idk its hard be an absurdist because I can&#039;t handle the temporaries of life. and now sitting here I hope the change I made in grace was right.

I want to be friends with her but I genuinely dk if I can.

I really hope for the best for her but I&#039;m also hugely disappointed that it&#039;s not with me. I feel like if I acknowledge this feeling ill be on my way to actually getting over it tbh. because I used to think feeling this posessiveness is morally bad and end up repressing it but now I&#039;ve realized that I have to acknowledge it&#039;s existence and that any emotion is never morally wrong because of the lack of control. so I&#039;m wearing my heart on my sleeve and being completely honest here that genuinely thinking about how her boyfriends &quot;defiles&quot; (or do</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/241303523_2720970434866978_3084348094104199064_n_17913766246967932.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202109/241303523_2720970434866978_3084348094104199064_n_17913766246967932.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/241105653_894180797847389_6876622223161467412_n_17909724332041290.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202109/241105653_894180797847389_6876622223161467412_n_17909724332041290.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdAOUQYk3S8ahgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17916481660931030" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdAOUQYk3S8ahgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17916481660931030"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/241364902_2183677438606358_3581352553339918460_n_18026089615311070.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdAO0zMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18122333701244914" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/FQIoAkMzLBdAO0zMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18122333701244914"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202109/241270339_874341673288077_5840241295906157415_n_17901370244308734.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Sep 2, 2021, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">I wore my jackets without my sleeves today&#039;s so I can be quirky. dubbed out in val today and won 5 games in a row. hit silver 2 off that shit. actually felt like I improved a lot and I&#039;ve been actually getting positives kds. my omen is actually good now. popped off in two of my games. also clutched two 1v3s. anyway today was first day of school and I saw grace today and there&#039;s so much tension. whenever she passes by me she like hides her face and idk its kinda sad tbh.

I just feel like I&#039;m telling everyone about my parents personal shit but today after lunch my mom apologized for being an emotionally immature mother. she basically was like I always assumed that it was your father that was emotionally immature and that I was very mature but I never supported you and I always tried solving your problems instead of solving yours. apparently she read about the 10 experiences of emotionally immature parents from this psychologist and she&#039;s like you guys been thru it. and she apologized because I always told her that she needed to change and she never did. also apparently my dad agreed to go to anger management therapy. and she was like yeah I realized that at this point you&#039;re more mature then me. and that she couldn&#039;t have done better when she was 17. and honestly things do feel easier in the household now. but idk maybe it was all the crying but her apology didn&#039;t make me feel any type of way. its nice that she was apologizing and finally realizing her mistakes but I cant find it in myself to forgive her. it just felt like she was just begging for my forgiveness. and only doing it so she can live with herself. but honestly if she just said what she did and took responsibility I would feel better. maybe I ask for too much. maybe I&#039;m just an asshole. but idk with all her crying and shit was it just felt like I was supposed to comfort her instead of actually thinking about how I feel about what she&#039;s done and whether or not I forgive her. I just told her it&#039;s fine a bunch of times because that&#039;s a much easier lie to say then I forgive you. really my it&#039;s fine is that I rather think everything is fine then me ever wanting her to change. because honestly i already accepted and embraced the fact that I dont want a relationship with my parents. maybe that&#039;s a shitty thing to say. sure makes me feel like an asshole. maybe I should just be happy about the fact that she has finally decided to work on herself</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202108/4F4E900393EC19F199DD140AB127FBA2_video_dashinit_17898647069117451.mp4" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/4F4E900393EC19F199DD140AB127FBA2_video_dashinit_17898647069117451.mp4"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAMBmZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17906759123092218" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAMBmZmZmZmhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17906759123092218"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240810686_978557316051600_1560421258715202679_n_17950039735512515.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAJAAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17945689279552137" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAJAAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17945689279552137"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240824095_1170746123402637_4841619754665070147_n_17908720519952810.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdALLtkWhysCBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17898860012218415" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdALLtkWhysCBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17898860012218415"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240384400_396081848799405_8887893147404486490_n_18181498324127803.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Aug 26, 2021, 8:01 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">Damn bruh I was playing badminton and I&#039;m ass but whatever. Today was the last time I&#039;m gonna see ryan cao and that shit kinda made me sentimental no cap. Like it finally kinda hit me that some mfs that I knew my whole life are gonna leave and shit. Like I wasn&#039;t even close to ryan but I mean idk its just kinda sad to see him leave. Like riri left too but idgaf about her LOL. And like idk it just kinda hit yfm. It&#039;s also just pretty braindead how every friendship is so temporary. Like I care and love like all of you but like its crazy that next year at this time I&#039;m gonna be saying goodbye to emma. Like I&#039;ve known that woman ever since grade 5 and recently we&#039;ve gotten really close. Obv I&#039;m gonna miss all my westmount friends but idk it&#039;s just crazy to think about. And recently I&#039;ve been really close to Arthur too and he&#039;s already in Montreal and that shit just kinda hits no cap. Nimai leaving soon too. And like I probably won&#039;t see arthur in a year and that just makes me sad no cap. Just generally tho friendships feel so temporary and shit, and when that shit is like one of the only reasons I have to live its difficult yfm. And like lowkey this all sparked cause like there was someone crying about leaving. (This kinda awkward cause she on the spam LOL but whayever). I feel like the hardest part on moving a new stage of life is just realizing that everything in the stage before was so temporary. And it kinda makes me not want to move on. Even tho this the worst stage of my life cause I got hella depressed. And like honestly I still miss grace thinking about. Honestly I feel like my relationship with grace was genuinely a more connected relationship then with angel. It&#039;s sad that I won&#039;t be able to have that genuine connection anymore. I&#039;m so shit with moving on with things tbh. When this stage actually happens in my life ima have another crisis. Honestly this type of thing where if you think about it you get sad but if you dont you dont care but that&#039;s honestly pretty shit too. Like I feel like as a friend I have a responsibility to be sad over these things because if I&#039;m not did those relationships even mean anything? Maybe everything means nothing and human</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAMfdLxqfvnhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17896262237156542" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAMfdLxqfvnhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17896262237156542"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/239441873_579673149879802_4413189171966560448_n_18008694628337173.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdALmZmZmZmZhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17931023536662295" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdALmZmZmZmZhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17931023536662295"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240592040_962040381245059_8024394945654982065_n_17896713056269632.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240527321_569782460720681_1759704069664887190_n_17940098821573396.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202108/240527321_569782460720681_1759704069664887190_n_17940098821573396.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdALMzMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17910215836912000" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdALMzMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17910215836912000"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240391834_982856039166802_6310452917099422551_n_18058874173289850.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAJ4gxJul41RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18177621610176405" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAJ4gxJul41RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18177621610176405"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240655657_527668178304298_7247240105148123972_n_17958513637476150.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/054ECA13A1B04CB71442A0C197EC138B_video_dashinit_18025701220309483.mp4" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/054ECA13A1B04CB71442A0C197EC138B_video_dashinit_18025701220309483.mp4"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240591404_531107587983298_5361088812263912595_n_17932275433646174.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Aug 24, 2021, 8:59 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">I be tired and shit. I slept at 5 and woke up at 11 to hang with nimai for the last time. Kinda sad tbh. I got my classes but ima change my shit around. Lowkey I don&#039;t even want to look who I have classes ik its gonna be with not a lot of people so idec. High key its more I&#039;m just lazy and ima just go with the flow and I have like 0 friends. Maybe I just post my classes on this story idek. I went to my therapy appointment today and just basically talked shit about my parents. My therapist agrees with me on most things so I feel less shit about a lot of things. It&#039;s also nice having a conversation about everything and like having a committed time to talk about shit in my life and having them ask good questions and guide me is just good. Also it&#039;s just nice having a mf that understands and validate how shitty my life is. Cause sometimes I be thinking I don&#039;t have it bad and I&#039;m like you a bitch Carsyn for being so emotional. Also I&#039;ve been really careless recently because I just don&#039;t care if my parents find out. Like I&#039;m in my rebellious teenager stage but also me and my therapist kinda determined that I just want my parents to let me be autonomous and do my own thing and just have faith that I&#039;m able to make my own decisions. Like that&#039;s a lot asking for Asian parents but idek it&#039;s what I want from them. It just feels like they don&#039;t know what supporting or loving me actually is. Nah they don&#039;t actually know. They just do it in the own convoluted way that makes me more depressed. Like my dad was like I&#039;ll always support and love you (which felt really manipulative just cause they&#039;re just empty words and the context was fucked) because that&#039;s how nature is. And I&#039;m just like bruh that&#039;s such a shitty basis for love. Like you love me because that&#039;s how things should be like bruh. This straight up like the logical fallacy where they just adhere to tradition. And that&#039;s the thing that is the most key flaw to my parents. These mfs have NO critical thinking. They just do whatever they believe in without questioning why. Like if they ever asked why they&#039;re together, why do I love my kids, why did i act like this, where does my anger come from, why does my child do this</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/240645330_568416721086422_1385780937625809545_n_17985500176383828.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202108/240645330_568416721086422_1385780937625809545_n_17985500176383828.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Device ID</div><div><div class="_a6-q">android-f6b6a001e7c55ba2</div></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Source type</div><div><div class="_a6-q">ANDROID_GALLERY</div></div></td></tr></table><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Has Camera Metadata</div><div><div class="_a6-q"></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Aug 23, 2021, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">Holy fuck yesterday I was so fucking bricked up in adrenaline. Like genuinely I&#039;ve never been so high on adrenaline in my life. And it happened in the dumbest way. So I sneaked out with this girl and yk we did our thing and we were just cuddling. And I wanted to turn the heat on. So I reach for my keys and it&#039;s not there and I cant find my fycking keys. For how genuinely fucking stupid I am that DAY i lost my keys at badminton and spent a hour searching it. SO I LOST MY KEYS TWICE IN A DAY. AND WE LITERALLY SPENT A HOUR IN MY CAR LOOKING FOR THE KEYS AND WE COULDNT FIND IT LOL. So its 4 am and I want to get the car back at 6. So I&#039;m like fuck it what if we call my sister and maybe she&#039;s willing to get a taxi and taxi to my place with the other pair of keys. But then right at that moment my PHONE DIES LOL. so  I think of something new. What if we run back to her house, she steals the keys and gives it to me, I drive and pick up the keys at my house drive back to her house and run 30 min back to my car and drive back. It would take about 2 hours but it seemed like our only chance. But I already felt so bad so I told her, and I said it a lot, if she doesn&#039;t want to do this shit I&#039;m willing to take the L and just call my parents and get caught. Cause like it&#039;s my fault anyways like I&#039;m fine with it yk. And like bruh my parents are kinda relaxed and I just don&#039;t want to create problems for other people. But she decides fuck it let&#039;s do this plan and we run in the pouring rain (omg so romantic!!!!) But then she realizes she can call her friend and maybe she will be willing to drive me (someone she&#039;s only heard of) all the way to my house and back. Keep in mind I&#039;m so bricked up on adrenaline were running and shit and like holy fuck this was so crazy. So she ends up picking up and she&#039;s so fucking cool and sneaks out at fucking 4:30am drives me to my house and back AND SHE DOESNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. like I legit love this woman bro. Like holy fuck she saved me so hard and she was so cool about it. Like not even considering she did this she was so cool and genuinely a person I can fuck with.

I played valorant today to cope with the pain of life and deranked. Whatever I wanna kms and val is my coping. Today was really ass. My family was having this conversation and it was literally making me mald. My dad just realized that him bitching and be angry fucks with the environment and makes his entire family feel like shit. Like genuinely is he fucking stupid. But I mean at least he owned up to it. But I don&#039;t trust this mf to change. Plus he was a little drunk. But he started going off about why he should lowkey be a Karen instead of properly dealing with his emotions. And idk mfs just braindead and shit got me malding depressed tbh. And then my mom was like yeah I realized the way to be happy when my dad is angry is that I realized his anger is his problem so I stop being angry. Which is just so shit because she just is complacent in letting him be a shitty person. And why would you ever want to be around someone who literally still cant solve their anger issues and just learned it fucks with the environment. Genuinely my dad literally only thinks about himself and nobody else. And I think its fucked up how my mom allows that. And in general my mom has literally allowed my dad to yell at me and basically traumatize me. Like she didn&#039;t even stand up for me. And now she won&#039;t stand up for herself. And everytime we would argue she would just be like both are wrong. But sometimes he was genuinely wrong and also I&#039;m a fucking child I&#039;m not supposed to be mature it&#039;s so unfair for me to have to deal with this. So it fucking angers me that she can continue this complacency. Just fucking leave him. And then my dad unironically said yeah ik being angry is wrong but if you call me out I&#039;ll be more angry. Mf just said I won&#039;t be held accountable for my actions. After this my parents were high key pressuring me on what I was thinking and I cracked and I told my dad that I don&#039;t trust him to ever change and my mom that she was being submissive complacent. And I mean maybe I should give him a chance but that&#039;s what I&#039;ve done my entire life. I even used my life to make him change. And he hasn&#039;t done it enough.

It just affects me emotionally and I feel like I should be over it. I mean tbh it just takes me a long time for me to get over people. Like it took me literally forever to get over angel and ig the same thing is happening again. I just think about our memories we had together and how close we were and shit like that and it makes me sad tbh. And for some reason just imagining her happy with her boyfriend just fucks me up. Not that we were ever in a relationship but I genuinely feel like she just replaced what we had with him and it makes me feel like ass. I mean ig I hope she&#039;s happy but idk shit makes me wanna die. And it makes me really sad to see her, the one who ultimately ended our friendship and fucked up, get to have a relationship and be able to replace me. I feel so vulnerable. Like anybody can pick me up and do whatever they decide with me. Honestly I&#039;ve thought about it and I don&#039;t want to be friends with grace anymore. I just want to move on with my life. I miss her a lot but I just want to move on. It&#039;s the type of thing where I can forgive what she&#039;s done but I can never forget. That felt really empowering to say. I found some catharsis in this post because I&#039;m holding her responsible for what she did. And her replacing me is stupid because she can&#039;t replace me. Not to be pretentious but I genuinely do feel like ik more about myself and what&#039;s important in relationships than other people my age. And I&#039;m honestly self reflective asf. Somebody like me is really hard to come by. Genuinely even tho I lose, it&#039;s her loss.

For context it&#039;s the mf that grinded and made it too princeton. But the other day I was catching up with her cause of badminton and I told her I dropped full ib and she was like ik. And I was like how do you know and she deadass was like yeah I expected you to drop. And I was like bruh how tf you gonna be so rude and for what. Actually just a shitty thing to say. And like I literally dropped because I was so depressed I tried to take my own life 😐😐😐. Albeit she doesn&#039;t know but still she doesn&#039;t know what I&#039;ve been thru and she just has the audacity to be so fucking rude. And in general riri just gives me heavy pretentious vibes just cause she made it to an Ivey. Like wow every Asian parent sucks your cock you&#039;re amazing. Idk just in general there&#039;s just so many ib kids that look down on partial and regular mfs and it genuinely pisses me off. I just really hate when mfs think I&#039;m dumb. Shit fr pisses me off or like not hard working. Cause I&#039;m not trying to be overly pretentious but just seeing how she grinds so hard every day just to say she goes to princeton and live a &quot;successful life&quot; just seems so sad tbh. Like her entire life just seems like work and idk she&#039;s smart but it feels like she never questions why she&#039;s doing it. Tbh I just don&#039;t respect riri at all, I feel like she&#039;s fake asf for networking reasons and just isn&#039;t real. And maybe what she said wasn&#039;t a big deal but it just reveals her pretentious attitude. Just so fucking rude to say it to someone&#039;s face too. And it&#039;s just worse cause I literally tried to kms doing full ib. Maybe I&#039;m jealous she&#039;s successful but I genuinely don&#039;t think I would choose the life of going to an Ivey unless I&#039;m trying to get a PhD in something I&#039;m passionate about. It just seems like she has no real purpose in life other than being successful. And that&#039;s just such a mundane life. And that&#039;s really who the people in the capitalist society reward. It&#039;s kinda sad thinking about how capitalism makes pretentious cunts like riri. On a completely unrelated note I&#039;m considering to stop joking about my attempted suicide cause it genuinely makes a lot of people</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202108/fOxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17899741361180452" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/fOxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17899741361180452"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/239634290_855888688390707_7165578641737762562_n_17885171138433013.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAOKpdsi0RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17907864923045723" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAOKpdsi0RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17907864923045723"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div><table style="table-layout: fixed;"><tr><td colspan="2" class="_2pin _a6_q"><div class="_a6-q">Subtitles</div><div><div class="_a6-q"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/236384418_565419704898009_1228160295831936252_n_17912005999887172.srt">Subtitles for video</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAIMzMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17866337777572406" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/FQIoAkMzLBdAIMzMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17866337777572406"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div><div><video src="media/posts/202108/D848AAB26A4EF8F219D7C591FD7E6DA5_video_dashinit_17862376793538822.mp4" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202108/D848AAB26A4EF8F219D7C591FD7E6DA5_video_dashinit_17862376793538822.mp4"><div>Click for video:</div></a></video><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Aug 17, 2021, 8:57 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">Legit played video games all day.

is explaining some bullshit. every single fucking one. and he always has to be right. the one time my mom objected to his thing they got into a big argument over literally nothing and it was so fucking stupid. and my mom is genuinely kinda dumb. it takes her some time to process or know what’s going on and it can be kinda triggering. honestly it’s sad and genuinely so annoying how she allows my dad to mansplain so fucking much. and we did all these boring fuckong things. like we literally toured hamilton. like for what? what’s the fuckong point. for the first half of the trip all we did was drive to these tiny ass uni towns and look at uni. and then look at the downtown because that’s important for some reason. it’s so fucking stupid. i genuinely don’t understand what my parents find enjoyment out of just looking at the queens campus or whatever. like their nice but it’s just not a fun thing to do. fuck man shit genuinely pisses me off. and like my mental health genuinely was so much worse i thought about offing myself so much. being around my dad is just such an ass environment to be in. he is so fucking pretentious and he just lowkey just shames you and is just an ass person. and after this trip mom was like yeah dad is one of the people i genuinely love the most. which confused me so much. like being in their interactions clearly it’s just shit interactions. idk she’s grateful for him because he does all these things to see things that are supposedly fun but like that’s literally called being a sugar baby. is that real love? idk man i literally can’t stand this guy. idk how he lives with himself with 0 friends and a son that hates him and only a wife. fuck man shit actually pisses me off. i got to explore montréal and toronto by myself. saw an andy

my house and we hooked up. and then she got drunk for the first time. lowkey idk how i feel about our relationship. like today after i nutted and we were cuddling i honestly felt really lonely. i just thought about how i have to replace a relationship with this type of connection and idk it just felt like i’m just doing this to cope with how depressing my life. i do feel like i’m guilting myself but idk. i felt better after tbh. it’s confusing, my feelings constantly change about her and our relationship and i genuinely do need to figure it out. i do feel like i’m guilting myself but also i do feel like i’m just using physical intimacy to replace the lack of emotional intimacy. but then again i don’t feel that bad with life rn. i’ve been making a lot of connections and genuinely having a good time. so idk i’ll see what i think about it. but hooking up is fun. another thing is idk if my pain is from being emotionally vulnerable or just being lonely. while she was drunk she told me that i could have so many other options cause i was so cool and easy to talk to and that shit kinds hit me tbh. it’s crazy to think about people actually like my personality. and it was genuinely a major boost in my confidence. and it kinda made me realize that my therapist is right about how people will actually like me. and that i’ve been just lowkey unlucky. and we talked about mental health and when she opened up about her mental health (where i think she def depressed while she denies it (which all depressed people think they aren’t depressed enough)). but thinking about how bad mental health is in our generation just makes me depressed. and shits such a hard issue to solve. world highkey fucked. tbh i don’t think we’re similar enough where i want to get really close with her. feeling upset but pretty good at the same time. sneaking out was fun</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video

grace. and she told me a lot of shit about how grace doing which kinda put me into my feels but idc anymore. i think so atleast. idk we ended up hooking up just because she’s from a strict christian household and she can’t really do anything. and i was just flexing about me wilding and shit. and she was like i really want to have my first kiss but not in a relationship cause that’s hard but with one of my friends. and i basically was like damn i’m right here let’s go back to my place. and it kinda just kept on escalating till i for head. and yeah it worked lmao? actually pretty crazy i didn’t expect that at all. esp the part where i was almost crying about grace to suddenly just hooking up with someone. lowkey the cuddling the best part no cap. i wonder what grace would think about this. anyways after that i hung out with nimai arthur and richard and it was pretty fun. we just played ball and talked. nimai and arthur went back to my place and i got super crossed and we just drank together. nimai was feeling pretty sick so me and arthur were just having conversations about random things and it was just a high convo. it’s pretty lit tbh. time passed by so fast. and today we just

ima feel ass again. i called out my dad for his shit attitude and tone and this mf was tryna argue with me but he backed down. lmao i hate this mf so much honestly. then i had this lengthy conversation with my mom and it was kinda depressing tbh. like she trying to be close to me but honestly i just don’t want it. which sounds like a piece of shit thing to say but idk i’m just so done helping her learn how to actually be someone i like being around. and she understood me but idk it’s just depressing to think about. but genuinely trying to help her just feels so ass, i feel like i’m constantly repeating myself and i feel like i constantly need to be uncomfortable for them to understand. and like i just don’t want to do that cause i don’t owe them that tbh. and highkey i’ve done everything i’ve can to tell them that they need to change. looks like attempted suicide project was a failure 😃😃😃. shits depressing honestly. and i was pretty uncomfortable talking to her like it just made me realize i just don’t want to help her. it’s pretty ass cause ik my mom got the best intentions at heart and she does love me but ig i just don’t want that. damn. that makes me feel like a piece of shit. it’s crazy i say i’m lonely all the time and won’t accept the love in front of me. i mean obv i want love on my own terms and where i feel comfortable but still. shit man this making me feel like ass. ik i did the right thing but it feels so ass doing it. cause ik i can’t help anymore and really i just want to be left alone. but shit makes me feel like i’ll never find love i’ll accept. fuck man shit making me feel unlovable. fuck my dad tho i ain’t feel bad about him. maybe i’m just ostracizing myself. shit makes me want to die</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

fucking bickers so much about everything in general it’s just kinda annoying. and sometimes he just yells for no reason and i’m just like bruh. i just genuinely don’t like being around this guy. and just the change of environment just made me feel so much shittier about everything it’s highkey annoying. and now that i’m back home i just feel shitty tbh. like i think the associations i have with my house are just outright negative. the only thing positive is my bed. and my bathroom. and highkey i’m gonna miss just hanging out with susie’s friends everyday. just cause it’s nice having people constantly over and just being able to talk idk. i’m definitely someone that really appreciates the presence of another person. and i just like talking i think. i really liked them too they’re just really chill and even tho i was clearly an outsider, it still felt pretty nice talking to them. i’m also sad i don’t get to drink and smoke weed. lowkey i realized how nice cigarettes are to like go outside and spend some alone time in the cold. like there’s a lot of times where i just needed an excuse to be alone outside and i was like damn if i smoked this would be very convenient. not saying i’m addixted or anything it’s just really good to have an excuse to take a break. also my rose coloured glasses of janine are over i don’t think i can fuck with her. when i first got into calgary everything just seemed so barren and depressing. being back here fucking sucks. life just heavy. i’m pretty sick of everything. no cap idk how to cope rn. ngl i think it’s pretty crazy how i haven’t cut yet cause i think about that shit so much. proud of myself ig. wanna try it out but ima listen to everyone who says it’s not worth it</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

and lowkey balled out there. i love muji no cap that store is just the vibe. i’m pretty tired and pretty sad i’m leaving van. i can’t smoke weed everyday 😔😔. but generally i’m just pretty tired. i definitely want to go home pretty bad and just rest. i’m pretty exhausted. i brought so much shit i regret it. it’s gonna be a grind bringing all my shit back. packing was so hard it was crazy. i regret bringing so much. lowkey been texting janine and it’s just really braindead. she eggs my sarcasm on so basically i’m going to talk to her more because i find myself extremely funny. talking to her unleashes my potential what can i say. i can’t seriously talk to any girls bro this a problem. i just say whatever and i think it’s hilarious. mad mfs probably think i’m weird asf. also i’m on bad terms with mad mfs. damn. my therapist says it ain’t my fault that i’m on the lowkey beef. but whatever. tbh even tho i want to go home i just don’t want to see my parents. it’s been so nice being away from my dad no cap. man is just annoying tf out of me. it’s crazy cause i been having dreams where we physically fight. idek why i hate this mf so much. no cap tho, talking to janine making me be like omg what if i cuff this woman and then she actually cares about me and then i’m finally happy and i have someone close to me. but that happens every time i start talking to a new girl. then i realize something about then and it’s incompatible with me and i’m like aight i’m a dumbass for even thinking i can find someone with my high standards. it happens every time tbh. and lowkey idek if i should be talking to her, janine and emma used to have mad beef and she’s the type of person who cares too much about fitting in with basic white girls and shit like that. tbh the only reason i’m remotely interested is cause she’s egging on my braindead conversation with her. also leon hitting on her so might have to just dip. idk tbh this is just so representative of just all my relationships. i feel like i never can really hold onto any friendship and i’m always so hopeful. it’s kinda annoying. i feel like</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

was super hype. i bought lolita (which i been trying to find) and the spirited away poster which is huge. oh and my sister bought these sunglasses that make me look super extra and rich. i feel so baller with those sunglasses. after that we went ate some pizza and went to the cat cafe. technically it wasn’t a cat cafe cause you just let cats for a hour but it might be a covid thing. they were really cute and super adorable. and bro cats got hops like they can jump so high. and they’re so small and tiny and it’s kinda adorable. after that we went home and i just chilled. hype for tomorrow. realized that my hair is so long i gotta start using hair gel cause that shit look like ass without it. honestly pretty used to the city life, but i realized how well calgary handles homeless people. apparently calgary is like the 4th liveable city which is crazy. but also i can just tell vancouver is more liberal. like in general everyone dresses in their own aesthetic which is respect tbh. you see more outlandish styles than calgary, maybe that’s just the street we went on tho. also there’s more people that dress outright queer and it’s dope. it’s kinda crazy to see how much the value changes here and i kinda like it. just from seeing a couple of men where skirts and women’s clothing, it kinda makes that shit normal to do and i kinda want to do it. also i saw two people with face tats today and i’ve never seen that shit in calgary so you can see how the general culture is different. but yeah other then that you can tell it’s a city. shits pretty cramped and shit but i’ve gotten used to it. i also have gotten used to just the atmosphere and the environment and it’s not uncomfortable to live in. initially things were pretty different but now i feel pretty comfortable tbh. i could get used to living here. and today was super fun tbh, i’m really hyped about the poster and i found studio ghibli soundtracks on vinyl but they were like a 100. all the stores are honestly so much nicer here and i just really fw this place.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

is known for first person autobiographical fiction (aka this shit reads like a spam post, they’re aren’t chapters but notebooks). many of the elements that happen to the main character yozo were taken from dazai’s life, and shortly after the writing of this book he committed suicide, leading many to believe that this book is his will. dazai (which is just a pen name) spent most of his life depressed or struggling with addiction, having attempted suicide four times with the last one being successful (mf has more privilege then me 😔), which is reflected in yozo. ever since yozo was born, he’s felt disqualified to be human, despising the two facedness of humanity and was sexually assaulted by his servants. these traumas would lead him to indulge himself with smoking, alcohol and prostitutes, and would continuously lament about his hatred of humanity and its nature. he plays himself as a clown in order to never reveal his true self to anyone, essentially ostracizing himself to save the pain of a relationship. yozo represents nihilism but most of all the pain of existentialism. though yozo often makes disgusting and morally wrong actions, the book concludes from an outside point of view that he was a good child. it depicts depression and the cynical cycle of hatred in the most real light, and it comes off as authentic and not as edgy or rebellious. yozo feels indescribably alienated but finds comfort in that alienation, as many rather be comfortable then be better. aight i’m done with this formal ass voice this book da shit ong. like he basically describes so many existential thoughts and questions what it means to live. he depicts mental illness as what it really is, because mental illness causes people to do a lot of shitty things (does that mean they shouldn’t be held responsible? probably not). he also depicts how easy it is not to connect with people and to be unauthentic but that causes you to run away from life itself and causes destruction. shits just insane bro just read it. it’s literally a well written version of my spam post while i’m depressed</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

for bachelor of science cause some don’t have in the arts. frfr pissed off. lowkey done with my parents. i determined that the question of should i still be vulnerable even tho it’s been taken advantage of, i’ve determined that i should just stay at the status quo cause basically a lot of my problems and problems in general come from people who are too scared to be vulnerable or honest or open. so now the question is should i stay vulnerable or should i die because humanity sucks. but yeah we staying vulnerable rn. also tbh i don’t think i’ll ever be able to close myself off even tho i say i want to. just cause i lowkey know it’s just so much better for me to be open. so yeah. didn’t do much today except nap but whatever. need to start grinding bio. i need to start reading more, i’m

time for the life of me. honestly i’m just ready to move out and have minimal interactions with my family tbh. i just don’t like them. i had a dream that i was arguing to my dad that he was controlling and when we went biking today he just kept on pestering me to do things his way. honestly it’s super fucking stupid but carol texted me today and it’s honestly fucking bothering me. i hate how my opinion on things changes depending on my mood. yesterday i was like i’m so glad i cut those people off and now i’m just like i hate you carsyn you can’t keep friends for shit. i have so much fucking hate in my heart just because i’m so miserable. and it feels like i can either hate myself or the world. i’m so envious of people who can just be happy. and it feels like i try so FUCKING hard. i try so fucking hard and for what? just for me to be more miserable. at the end of the day everyone knows they aren’t as miserable as i am. and i feel like that just discredits me so much. like people can just be like why tf should i care about what he thinks he literally wants to kill himself. i feel so lonely but i want to be alone. just because i’m so sick of being used and being vulnerable and just getting that used against me. honestly i actually hate amina and carol. the fact i hate the most is that they won’t have to take responsibility for their actions. because everyone thinks they are such amazing fucking people and they probably think that themselves. i hate that about them. because they’ll never change. you can’t change if you never take responsibility. and they’ll always get away with it because if you play nice people will like you. but i mean at the end of the day there’s so much hatred inside of me. i either be vulnerable or i hate. ik it’s okay to hate them because i’m holding them responsible internally but idk. i just want to reject humanity and my own humanness. it’s sad to think about the only reason i’m not dead is because i’m scared of dying. i’m sick of being used. i open my heart up and every time people hollow it out. fuck man. i can go on for hours about how much i hate. my</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video

couldn’t fucking sleep till two. like bruh my body hates me. i woke up at 10. and then did my morning routine and woke up at 1. so braindead. honestly so glad i removed those 4 tbh. it feels really liberating. and not be immature but i don’t even want to reach a mutual understanding cause it’s more fun and easier to hate. honestly this was way easier then grace, i actually cared about grace and she was lowkey meant more then the 4 of them combined. also grace was so sudden but this felt way more gradual which made it easier. i can’t help but think i’m the toxic one just cause i’ve cut off a lot of close friends but i mean i have some pretty rational reasons for both. i have 3 hours and 40 min left of the hobbit and i might finish it after this post. genuinely tired asf today because i hung out with jun and we biked and it was pretty fun. it was nice catching up with him and we also met up with emma they talked for the first time in like two years. i def been feeling a lot closer to emma recently just cause of similar situation and idk. it’s nice having a friend ever since grade 5 (even tho we haven’t been close the entire time). didn’t do much work today but i had a lot of fun. actually fun isn’t the right word but i just thoroughly enjoyed my day. also i realized i go between being down bad and horny asf to wanting someone to have a really good relationship. but in all honesty idk if i really want a relationship rn. i feel like investing in the close friends i have rn. because honestly i feel like relationships are overrated. having a solid and strong support system with a lot of friends is much better tbh. i gotta read michel de montaigne essay on friendship because it’s really infamous and he talks about the different types of love and just having a good support system. i don’t mean to flame any particular person, but i feel like people really want a relationship just because they’re missing the intimacy from their friends and the different types of love. but they think they can make up their lack of platonic or family love for romantic. but</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

moving for like 5 days. literally thought i was gonna throw up. im actually so fat now it’s not funny. it also might be because i just drank yesterday. i got like 4 hours of sleep which is so ass. i’m actually so genuinely tired rn. the party yesterday was legit hype asf. i got so fucking drunk and wasted. got so fucking floored and don’t remember much but i got absolutely floored. it was so

and i left the gc too. i would explain the beef but i’m just too tired. maybe another day. but it’s braindead cause they just seem like such huge hypocrites and pussies. lowkey never trusting a person that does interact or su cause those mfs fake asf. feels really liberating. lowkey this all started off in a pretty braindead way but i genuinely never take disrespect. so it started with me complaining about my CART cause i got straight 80s and i was sad about it. and lowkey bickering and shit, yk expecting comfort. but then amina after i said i got 80s was like omg i did so bad. and i’m like what’d you get and she’s like 95 83. like bruh 😐😐😐. why would you say you did bad after you literally did way better then me. and then i was like how did you do so well. and she deadass said maybe i just tried harder. and that shit fucking triggered me so hard. like why tf would you say that even if you did? like sure you care about your grade but that’s just the most pretentious thing

cringing and lowkey embarrassed it was bad idk. and then he barged into my room and it just kinda pissed me off. dunno. feel like my relationship with my parents will never be better then what i currently have. too much has been done to ever let me look at them in a different light. not to be like omg i miss grace so much!! but like i kinda wish i had someone to talk clothes about. lowkey i’ve been just considering reaching out to her again and see if time has changed how our interactions are. but idk. i feel pretty bad thinking about it too. and i feel like our relationship isn’t really salvageable just cause it’s just so awkward what’s happened. my lows are pretty low and ass then before i think. i’ve been depressed for a long ass time. mans really been going through it huh.

such a short story. so ig spoiler ahead. one theme is that the idea of something is scarier then the appearance. the whole family is horrified and disgusted by how gregor looks but when he dies they’re completely fine with looking at him. which signifies that what really horrified his family was the idea that he became such a creature rather then his appearance which we are first led to believe. another theme is the arbitrariness and abursidity that money holds in our society. when gregor first wakes up from his metamorphosis the only thing that really stresses on his mind is his job and work, and not the fact that he’s an insect. this at first seems absurd to the reader but slowly after seeing how the family has had to suffer from the lost of his income, it really becomes apparent how important money is and why that stress meant so much. along with this life is just absurd, things just happen without any intention and many of the characters are not extremely surprised by his appearance. sympathy has its boundaries, even tho it’s a shit thing to say he is actually a burden to a family. it causes him to be depressed and to jill himself but at the end of the day people have to prioritize there own lives. also the notion that physical form dictates mental form is also a theme. because he is physically an insect he slowly becomes more and more like an insect mentally, even in his attempts to reject that metamorphosis. i think the biggest theme out of this whole book is regardless of appearance to treat everyone the same. like i remember my ela 10 teacher told us that when he asked homeless people what the worst part is that when people ignore them because it dehumanizes them i’m like damn ima not do that. and tbh homeless people are pretty nice they just look scary and shit. and i think it’s the same here. if his family just got over his appearance (which they can clearly do which is apparent at the end) this wouldn’t have been a tragedy. but because of his form and the increased burden they put on them, they dehumanizes him and look at him with disgust. however when he dies</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

that’s why it took me so long. but holy fuck this book is good. idk if it’s because i annotated so much but it’s so so good. the writing is harrowing and gripping. literally made me feel this big ball of tension and unease in my heart. love it. the antagonist is literally the goat antagonist. his philosophy and character is so so so well made. it’s interesting but disgusting and depraved at the same time. like he rarely made king speeches but when he did i literally highlighted the entire page. my favourite quote, and it’s simple but when you read what it’s around it it’s insane, is “god is war.” also this book isn’t for the faint of heart, the imagery is graphic and the entire book is about depravity and violence. and it’s very graphic. it explores the nature of violence and depravity and what makes people motivated to do it. but ultimately the quote from a review in the front of the novel said it best, “a classic american novel of regeneration through violence.” spoilers ahead. the whole character arc of the kid, who is never named, is that at the start he is a bloodlustful violent individual with no humanity in sight. we are taken on an adventure of extreme violence where they kill aboriginals and scalp them for money. the novel increasingly gets more depraved and contrasting the antogonist, the judge, the kid becomes more human and his morality is revealed. the judge thinks of the kid as his ideal son (because of his beliefs) and tries to enforce his values onto him. but the kid rejects his beliefs. eventually the judge realizes his ideal son will never be like him and kills him in such a gruesome way that novel refuses to describe it even tho we’ve seen some really shitty things. the judge kills the kid in order to push away the fact that he is alone in his journey. nobody will join the judge with his depravity. ultimately he may be the last one standing but he is alone in the world. his acts of depravity isolate him. also the novel concludes that ultimately evil will outdo good but evil is lonely which anybody can do</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

fucking feel like a burden. constantly too. and because of that i just feel constantly anxious that i fucked something up. and that i did something wrong. and i believe all my anxieties and i’ll just be depressed. my heart is just aching and fuck i just don’t want to do this shit anymore. and i try so hard to not believe i’m not a burden but it’s so hard. and there’s been so many experiences that have proved what i’m saying right. and fuck i don’t know how to cope with it. i genuinely don’t know. my life is just sapped with my enjoyment. and i’m scared to reach out because i’m too much. and it feels like i’m back to square one. i haven’t improved at all. and i feel like i’m going to start pushing people away to protect myself. i’m holding on to the little meaning i have but i just want to let go. it just feels like i lost in life. i carved my own path and it led me to dead end. and ngl the book i’m reading isn’t helping. it’s just this book about deprsvity and violence which makes me super depressed. apparently it concludes on how people find meaning in all of this but as i’m reading it it makes me more depressed. but i just feel like a burden to my family and friends tbh. been really depressed for more then a year now. my therapy bill probably destroying my parents wallet. maybe i should just delete this account. i just use this shit for pity points anyway</div><div

_a6-i">okay it’s 1:30 am and i finished reading hamlet. first of all, at the end i rushed everything and annotated nothing cause i just wanted to finish the book and see what happens. but i end up just not appreciating or understanding the text at all so it’s like bruh. shakespeare legit the goat in using language tho. like he’s so good at figurative language and making witty jokes and just uses the english language to the fullest capacity. he uses it so well that it’s hard for me to appreciate it. shakespeare has the most extensive vocab out of any author. there’s so many banger quotes in this play it’s crazy. shakespeare ultimately concludes that vengeance is never the answer. the biggest theme in this play important responsibility is. spoilers ahead. hamlet starts off feigning his madness in order to achieve an end and ends up doing lots of devious actions. at a certain point it is unclear if he is merely feigning his madness as he begins doing things irrationally. at a certain point he becomes completely mad because he does not take responsibility, he attempts to justify his manslaughter which makes him more disillusioned. when confronted with the consequences of his actions of the death of ophelia he begins to understand that he has to take responsibility which he slowly does. he expresses sorrow for her brother and understands his anger and finally becomes rational. then he demands his friend to live in order to tell what happened, taking complete responsibility as he no longer wishes to hide his actions. this shit basically crime and punishment but better. it also shows the destructiveness of trauma on individuals and the downward spiral it causes. also it shit talks people in power cause they just suck anyone’s dick to stay in power and have no morality. the foil between hamlet and laertes is good. hamlet is too human to a fault while laertes is too logical. another big theme is the motivation and emotions of humans. it’s very paradoxical how some are willing to give up their morality and life for stupid causes while others find it so hard to do an action and hold onto their morals. it speaks a lot to how morality is weak. in order to be on top in this world</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202106/210077916_367045201443736_9169981147265140135_n_17922481054671678.jpg"><img

really does. it just feels like i can’t release my emotions and pain. i just want a good cry tbh. it feels worse having all these ass emotions building up in my heart. anyways today i legit just felt like holden from catcher in the rye. i read hamlet for a bit and the entire afternoon i was just purposelessly wandering around the city not doing anything. and it was so depressing. i just felt so lost and i was just trying to find something to keep me grounded. it was honestly really depressing. then i had my therapy session and just got more depressed. i be having destructive thought patterns and wanting to ostracize myself. definitely one of the most depressing therapy sessions recently. i went home and napped for like two hours. spending my time in solitude. reading is my escape but that shit hard asf to do. esp when i’m depressed. honestly scared asf i’m going to get hurt again. feel like a helpless kitten on the streets.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

and went back downstairs and literally napped till 4. got up again and didn’t do shit for 2 hours. legit all i remember doing was wandering around the house lowkey having a breakdown. and going on youtube. after dinner finally went out of the house and actually felt better. day 2 of feeling like i’m being understood so that’s nice :)). talked about shit about my life. and generally actually had a good time. now i’m back and i feel better but still kinda depressed. legit just going to read all summer. reading is the only reliable thing that gives me joy so fuck it i’m gonna grind idc. shits fun. haven’t been reading these past two days because of my mood which is pretty bad because i’m tryna habit build but whatever. probably going to have a boring ass summer but whatever i’ll be drinking a lot. thankful for the friends i have rn, making me feel less alone these days. realizing a lot of things about my life and even tho i feel really shitty, i feel like i have a good grasp on things. i want to cry to release all these emotions but can’t cry. i want to cry so much but i feel like i’ve felt so much emptiness and negativity that’s it’s hard for me to cry these days. i just feel i’m too empty to cry. which sucks sometimes crying is really nice cause you sob and then you feel okay after. maybe my hearts just too fortified to cry nowadays</div><div class="_3-95

chilling and being braindead. also needed to get out of the house and move, been sitting down and reading too much. felt pretty good after my spam post last night and this morning, but my mood is souring. just feeling empty and sad in general. highkey thinking i should actually go to psych and go big and try to be a therapist. feel like it’s genuinely one of the most rewarding things i do in my life. gonna need atleast my masters and probably my doctorates but whatever. i’ll kms if i don’t make it. as my favourite artist, jpegmafia, said “And if i ain’t rich before 26, well fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club.” i talk about death so casually but that’s because i’ve thought about it so much. it’s quite sad if you think about it. want to do a dopamine detox and just go clean off my phone. yesterday late at night i felt really happy because i felt like there was hope for me to have relationships with vulnerability. i felt a lot of joy and idk i just felt really happy. it’s been a long time since i’ve felt that way to that extent. i felt understood. so that was really nice :). i feel like i’m really rigid of my opinion but also i feel like i’m thinking the truth. i think a new chapter of my life will be starting really soon; i’ve changed so much that my environment has to start to change. feelings of emptiness and isolation keep on surrounding me in this moment and my heart feels tense and heavy. i really wish i could see the beauty in life more. nihilism constantly surrounds me. didn’t read today because i was so busy. i haven’t been hugged in a long time. actually that’s a lie i did when i was drunk. idk i just want to be a helpless child hugging its mother and trusting she can fix everything. haven’t felt that type of love in a long time. where things are okay because you have people that love you. i wish i had a good relationship with my parents. but i like the idea of it more then my actual parents</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202106/209095340_891718688220950_4774592340124893872_n_17977032787387592.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202106/209095340_891718688220950_4774592340124893872_n_17977032787387592.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202106/207587780_236869611308585_2124386531307981599_n_17846621054614182.jpg"><img src="media/posts/202106/207587780_236869611308585_2124386531307981599_n_17846621054614182.jpg" class="_a6_o _3-96" /></a><div></div></div></div><div class="_3-94 _a6-o">Jun 26, 2021, 8:18 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2ph- _a6-g uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-95 _2pim _a6-h _a6-i">“O that this too too sullied flesh would melt,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew” that line from hamlet fr go dummy. i read like a third of hamlet today but annotated the shit out of it. it’s short but requires so much annotation. honestly, i’m starting to love shakespeare. he’s just so good at writing and using the english language. every line seems sooo dramatic and impactful and just the clever way he uses language makes the emotional impact so much more. i have to read more of his works because he’s genuinely so good. i didn’t appreciate at all before cause i didn’t annotate and was forced to read it, but fr this guy writes dummy nice. and for hamlet the way he builds hamlet as a character makes him so likeable and relatable i actually love him. idk his writing is unmatched and i’m expecting hamlet to be one of my all time favourite works. anyways today was not a productive reading day at all, i kept on opening and then closing books. i did spend a lot of time reading hamlet but not as much as i would like and as i’m used to. but that’s because i was feeling really shorty today. i slept at 2 and woke up at 4 and then slept again so i had a really ass night. and what kept me up was just me lowkey having a breakdown about my life. reading has become my escape from everything and it gives me a lot of joy but still, those feelings of emptiness and worthlessness come up. really this entire day and night i’ve been engulfed in nihilism. thinking about how climate change will probably end the human race in 20 years is depressing to think about, and my day to day life is pretty sad if i’m going tbh. so i’ve spent the last 24 hours tossing and turning in my bed because of my hatred and guilt for being human. the paradoxical nature of human nature is that the immense complexity is what makes life worth living but also forces me to constantly question my own human nature and morality thereby making me have an intrinsic hatred for myself. i feel this need to be perfect and better but i never reap the benefits. shit makes me feel fucking suicidal asf knowing all my psychological needs aren’t being met. i think the truth about the world i hate the most is why am i</div><div class="_3-95

i went thrifting for books and bought 6 books 😭😭😭. worth asf. really hyped about one hundred years of solitude, anna kareina and jane eyre. and the anthology too. but yeah now i’ve filled one of my shelves with basically classics. as i said i couldn’t read much today. i got through one chapter of iliad and some of hamlet but it was hard to read a lot. felt tired and groggy all day. i went to a thrift store and was really hot then i started coughing and i thought i got covid and was so scared. but after 5 minutes my cough went away so i think i’m fine. also i got my second shot literally a week ago. this new tyler aight ain’t something too amazing. literally have nothing to rant on this spam because i’ve been grinding reading.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

it’s actually habitable. also organized my shelf and it looks pretty nice. spent basically the entire day reading. read 234 pages which is about 4 hours of reading and finished catcher in the rye in one day. book review (spoilers ig). this book is pretty good. i didn’t have very high expectations but it was a nice book. the thematic exploration wasn’t amazing but it was pretty good. holden character is well made and even tho very angst very relatable. it explores the alienation in the loneliness people, people get hurt and close themselves off. but they can be opened up through love but ultimately it’s more of a self thing. when phoebe is riding the carriage that shit was touching asf and i was like damn. it really showed the image of like an adult looking at a child and shows how holden has finally grown up. tho holden loves the innocence of childhood and be the “catcher in the rye” holden doesn’t realize how shitty children are and downplays it. he holds on to his innocence really hard but ultimately fails. when the thought of jane fucking that one character it represents how his innocence has lost to lust, and he never feels like calling her cause he doesn’t want to confront his emotions and talk to her as an adult. his red hat represents his uniqueness but also his insecurity to be unique, constantly self conscious about it. he thinks all adults are phony, and even tho he is right, he lacks the introspection to call himself out. he even ironically says he fears the day he becomes phony and doesn’t know about it. but ultimately the most important theme is the alienation one. it concludes that life is mainly worth living for others really. he yearns for connection but also alienates himself to protect himself. but it’s impossible to appreciate life without appreciating the people and things around it. ultimately i think the relationship between holden and phoebe is so strong because even tho phoebe has all these annoying flaws, he never calls them phony or really is affected by it. he just accepts them. he’s willing to look past all that and see that phoebe really</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

just nothing to really do in this city sometimes. also copped moby dick at goodwill and it’s so cheap that it’s a crime not to buy books. nothing really to say, was pretty happy today even tho i didn’t read. hung out got a long time. i can’t get myself to read iliad today. i opened the book like 4 times and closed it reading like 2 pages. hopefully i’ll feel like reading tomorrow. lowkey i might read after for a bit because i don’t want to miss a day just so it becomes habitual. lowkey wish i had a person to hang out everyday and just chill with. not necessarily having to do something but just to chill with. but unfortunately don’t have that person 😔. it’s okay tho being alone isn’t so bad. i’m finding things i enjoy and everyday doesn’t seem as long it used to be. might get a job this summer cause i’m broke asf. but idk also lazy and just want to grind reading. glad i haven’t been feeling absolutely ass these couple of days. which is nice but still really uncertain about things but feeling okay about it. the heaviness is definitely not there :)</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

and it made me pretty sad and feel like shit but also was nice just to talk about shit. my therapist is always so nice to talk to. tbh i look forward to talking to her every week just so i can process through shit i’m going through it just update her on my life. honestly a lot of our conversations is just asking really existential questions. i always have the tendency to let problems in my life become existential issues about human nature. for me i just expand my scope, one thing has so many implications for other. gonna read the iliad next and while reading that probably will read catcher

book review for now. read this shit for like 3 hours to finish it. 160 pages read. okay highly disappointed again. i expected this to be atleast a 8/10 and probably a 9/10 because my favourite critic gave it a 9/10. but it’s shit. first off the entire book is boring asf except the last 50 pages. which is very subjective but whatever. i think the themes are very poorly explored. the only character that truly develops is like the 3rd most relevant character. so we end up not seeing any of the development. honestly it’s more like he just changes all the flaws about himself in one night. and the main character is legit too perfect. like sure this is a good revolutionary during the 1800s but like her whole thing is that she is an independent woman. and there’s many points where i’m like wow she’s so independent and actually stands up for herself and that’s dope. but also boring as hell cause she’s basically a static character. sure she is prejudice against one of the characters and ends up getting rid of it but like the prejudice is pretty reasonable. he acts like a piece of shit and is known to be prideful. he has no manners and civility. he sucks absolute cock at making small talk and pretending to be friendly. obv she’s not gonna think highly of him. so essentially her character is stagnant asf. the theme that love rooted in different values is explored, but explored like shit. shit just felt like it was stating facts with examples. like wowwwww what a shocker, a woman loving a guy just to be the first to get married will end up bad wowwwww. so insightful!!!! it’s commentary on social issues is okay, i think the only good thing is that the main character is very empowering to women at the time. but other then that it doesn’t explore how braindead social conventions are. this is just a much shitter version of a dolls house. tbh it’s not even comparable. i genuinely don’t know how this has a 4.23 on goodreads. it just feels like twilight for women in the 1800s. thank god this isn’t on the /lit top 100. the only thing redeemable is the last 50 pages and the writing is pretty cool and enjoyable to</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

just so boring for me definitely not my thing. i read a lot of pride and prejudice, hopefully i can finish it tomorrow. it’s much harder for me to focus on normal books rather then audiobooks but i’m working on it. still was able to get through a 100 pages. hopefully i can making reading a habitual thing this summer. ate a good dinner too. tbh the evening was the same heaviness i feel everyday but after some things i definitely feel less lonely and understood. it’s a nice feeling and hopefully i can feel that feeling more. that really made my night and i’m genuinely in a good mood. idk it was

_a6-i">so i just listened to 11.5 hours of crime and punishment today so it’s time for a review time. first of all i’m kind of disappointed but that is because i thought very highly of the book. i thought it would be easily a 10 and contend with eva but that didn’t happen. really the title is basically the story, the protagonist does a crime and his punishment is outlined. it explores the flaws in western philosophy such as existentialism, utilitarianism, nihilism and ubermensch (even before neisctzhe) and basically concludes that the philosophical beliefs of russian christianity were better (which was quite a conflict during dostoyevsky time of writing). i think the best explored theme is that crimes or immoral actions will weigh on the human conscience and causes the criminal to be unable to receive or give love properly. one must repent or take responsibility for there actions. but along with that one must receive unconditional love (even if they are unable to accept it) in order to change or be better. it also explores how shit poverty is and how horrible it is. some aspects it was explored well and others it’s meh. i think the main problem i have which won’t let me rate it higher is that the themes are just not explored as well as i thought and the book does not represent much; it only represents one idea and not multiple ideas or even the entirety of life. i don’t feel the complexity of the issue has been explored lots. that being said the ability of dostoyevsky to deconstruct atheistic philosophy is admirable and is one of the first to shit on existentialism and utilitarianism in literature. but what i find most impressive about dostoyevsky writing is his writing. i found myself very entertained throughout the novel and very emotional at the end. he builds up the characters very well and i think this is one of the best novels (in terms of appeal) i’ve ever read. there’s a reason i was able to sit for almost 12 hours reading this book. it’s fucking entertaining even with its somewhat mundane plot. and i felt my heart aching at the final couple of chapters. this book truly is able to make the reader very emotional and make one feel as guilty as the protagonist.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202106/202141070_218663940087321_2810129120566495656_n_17900389952025417.jpg"><img

BRO legit spent the whole day reading. i read a lot of crime and punishment, i was considering binging like 14 hours worth of content in a day but decided not to. nevertheless mans grinded. also i read some poetry and it’s fun but also i hate reading archaic shit like that shit barely english. also i’m really shit at interpreting. ran my whole day on caffeine and it wasn’t that bad, caffeine feels better then what i remembered. might run all my free time on caffeine from now on. listened to a lot of music too, ran thru a couple of new albums today. probably gonna end the day by listening to music or reading poetry. need to finish crime and punishment and pride and prejudice. reading list rn is catcher in the rye and beloved. future reads are probably moby dick (hopefully i don’t get bored but apparently the book is insane), ulysses (probably a read when i actually get good at reading), infinite jest (shit will take me 2 months to read and hard asf), catch 22, more kafka? brothers  karamovz (shits a 37 hour book 😔), 1984, the idiot, notes of the underground, app years of solitude, blood meridian, slaughterhouse-five, low key want to read the bible, homers mythology and shit, lolita (actually that’s next read it’s a first person view on a pedophile and it’s pretty insane), stoner, no longer human, american psycho, dune (for a casual read). i need to also finish reading vagabond and i want to read other manga such as goodnight punpun, beseek, love is war. shit my reading list huge asf. hopefully i read some of the books i listed. we will see. also want to go on a tv show/ anime grind but i’m binging books rn so can’t be bothered with that. also need to get through my poetry book. jesus i’m setting my expectations way too fucking high. hopefully i read a couple, actually hopefully i read the books i currently have.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202106/A84ADA9824AD097D8D2BD24B069AB1B5_video_dashinit_17899800527030639.mp4"

enjoy the poetry unit the most so i want to try it out. i’m going to have a reading and listening to music grind this summer. also it’s sad that i’ve spent $500 on vinyl but whatever. but i don’t regret it i like my vinyl. discovering new music and motivated to listen again. off the youtube chris chan grind and on the reading grind. today was fun hung out with ryan but tired lowkey. took care

realized i’m still pretty depressed. wish i had someone that i was really close with. kinda envious with people that do ngl. like i joke about wanting bitches all the time but i kinda need a really

state of vulnerability with somebody but don’t feel comfortable around the ppl i currently know. but honestly i’m kinda tired of searching. i feel like i meet someone i really can bond with and it

_a6-i">some of my favourite calvin and hobbes strips these last couple of days. the two strips i saved but only half of it is my favourite. lowkey really tired a lot and it’s pretty bad. don’t feel like going to school it’s so cringe. just have to grind english and shit and i just want it to be over. felt better today about everything but still feeling traces of emptiness and hopelessness. lowkey was feeling good a couple weeks back but now i’m back to my same old kinda depressed self so yeah :/. wish i saw my therapist more highkey. i need to find the motivation to read a book. i want to make it a habit so i don’t binge read and don’t do anything other days. other then that idk i’m realizing a lot of things about my life. i’m in constant of change and it’s pretty lonely and tiring but it feels so necessary. lowkey been thinking about stopping this spam because maybe i want to keep things to myself and journal privately. but tbh i won’t have the motivation to write anything in it if i do it in private. also there’s somethings i can’t rant about like secrets i have with friends or just underlying conflicts for example when i was friends with grace that are really distributing me. plus a lot of the times when i’m in a breakdown and i try to write it down it’s genuinely so hard and it takes me 30-40 minutes to write a post about how shitty i’m feeling. really this account has been my therapy account but it’s not that useful and idk how i feel about constantly releasing my emotions to everyone cause it makes me wonder what people actually think about me. also managing my followers is a pain cause like it’s awkward to remove people and i won’t remove someone unless i really hate them so like old friends know about the new me which is weird. plus i feel like i can’t really say what i want to say on the spam when i have breakdowns or just about current things going on in my life. overall tho, i’ve been feeling more lonely and disconnected from my friends so it feels like i’m talking to brick wall. i’ve started to realize that a lot of people don’t understand me or being depressed and things like that and i don’t want to fight for understanding. just need that release.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202106/198412116_200163765312968_2879374701748702331_n_17904640003948632.jpg"><img

_a6-i">just finished reading the trial by kafka. i read almost the first half like quite a while ago and just finished the entire thing tonight. so book review. it’s going to be shitty cause i still time to process everything. but i think this book definitely deserves another reading. i think at a technical standpoint there’s a lot. tons of subtle symbols and motifs. and at the surface it’s just shit talking bureaucracy and totalitarianism but i think it speaks a lot to our society too and also the human condition. ultimately, justice is done for victory and not for justice, we can see this in cancel culture and how profitable the justice system is. and i think the most important point kafka brings up is that the reality is we’re all just dogs in this world that are controlled by other dogs. and ultimately society wears us all down to accept our fate.  i really enjoy how dark kafkas writing is, how depressing and gritty it is. it describes the bureaucracy well and in a really shitty light. really it shows the grittiness of life, our fate is really not up to us and we get work down by that fate until we give in and die. the people that are used to their fate don’t realize how muffled the air they breathe is. i need to definitely reread one of the chapters cause it’s so so confusing and idk what it means. whether or not we want to we can’t escape the system and it constantly controls our life. and at the end of the day society wears its citizens down of all its humanistic features to benefit itself. and it displays the question on is life worth living really well. the more you think about it the more complex the issue is and it becomes emotionally draining that it affects all aspects of life. but you want to constantly think about it because you feel like if you can find the conclusion you’ll understand everything. but that’s a thing of legend an actual “acquittal” or acquitting to be human. you can only prolong it in the back of your head or temporarily ignore it unril it pops up in your head again. and it drains you emotionally. ultimately, it shows the importance of accepting ones on faith. actually scratch that. the only thing important is being true to yourself</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202106/196888967_881287305799369_6694399367531378103_n_17904605239875275.jpg"><img

assignments, hopefully finish two tomorrow. got caught speeding unfortunately 😔😔😔😔. gotta pay a fine now. mood shifting from feeling really shitty to feeling okay. but yeah overall pretty hype. can’t believe schools almost over. but i gotta grind my ass off this week cause art 😁😁😁. and english too. but other than that i’m enjoying myself i think. didn’t hang out with my friend group this weekend

the summer. i hung out with ryan a lot and it was nice. we just went around comic book stores looking at manga and we met up with jun. hopefully i can out with the old westmount group again. nothing too much, i felt pretty good tonight and was vibing out which was nice. i feel a lot better for whatever reason and that’s nice. i need to pass this bitch ass art class. gotta actually grind tomorrow. wanna listen to more music and consume more media. just got to get into the cycle because the reason i’m not motivated rn is because it’s not a habit and i haven’t felt the rewarding features of it in

people and shit and then i come home and i nap cause i’m really tired and all of a sudden my motivation to do anything is very low and like i get mad anxiety from nothing. i did hw when i got home but i lowkey couldn’t get anything done because i had no motivation and was feeling really anxious and agitated. i’m always feeling emotions that aren’t rooted in any thoughts, been thinking about killing myself even tho nothing happened and literally anxious about nothing. also i hate humans. people can do the most atrocious things in the world and are still able to get empathy from me. i think what mesmerizes me the most about chris chan is that he can be so evil but i understand why he is. and it’s sad. it feels like there’s a constant amount of pain in the world and it gets transferred from one person to another and increases every time. people can commits act like the holocaust or the 215 dead children and they’re human. the worst part is 215 doesn’t even seem like a lot of people. but it is a lot. i feel like i’m just so desensitized to death and tragedies because i truly feel like there’s more evil then good in the world. every time i see people i just look at how they’ll someday cause pain to themselves and others. when i look at society i just see how perfectly greedy and destructive it is, but it feels like it is perfect because it seems like no other society can exist. the political powers of the world will probably fuck us over and we will die. in a world where we evolved passed survival as latch on to meaningless things that ultimately create destruction. the more i think about it, the more flawed humans are. how are humans supposed to live when they’ve evolved passed living?</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

my core needs aren’t being met but i’ve never had my core needs before. so idk if i ever will want to live cause i’ve never felt what it feels like to feel fulfilled. i’m pretty sure i lowkey had a panic attack today and that shit was really nice 😁. unstable asf today. cried like 5 times but it’s not a sob it’s a lowkey cry and it’s ass. feeling really alone. i can’t trust myself anymore. i

but trigger warning if you’re gonna read the manga, they’re displays of rape and drilling a hole into your head and also suicide. but anyways back to the review. i feel this review will be half assed cause i need more time to think about it. but it’s very experimental in terms of how it plays with perspective, genuinely a very confusing manga to read because it comes from basically a deluded person (or possibly not) and his perspective on issues. so horrific crimes he has done seem okay because of the experimental perspective and is genuinely very confusing. i feel like this manga can be easily interpreted the wrong way (he rapes someone for her “own good”, and often completely destroys people to reconstruct them) but i think if we consider the manga as a whole, it is really a commentary about how easy it is to make people feel empathetic for shitty people and because he reaches his own demise in the end, it shows how deluded this guy really was. the commentary is insane, there’s commentary about society and ultimately what it means to be human and questions everything about being human to its core. it questions whether it’s ethical to completely destroy someone to reconstruct them and shows how much influence you should put in order to help them change. and honestly i can relate to certain aspects of the character a lot and it’s gotten me to question whether or not i’m on the same destructive path. by showing humans and their depravity as well as their flaws in clear view, it really questions on what being human is. ultimately, the people in the bottom of society and the top 1% are much of the same. the ability the empathize with every character is something that is truly a skill done by the author and questions how our society is constructed as well as question the validity of ourselves. this book is pretty insane this is atleast a 9.5 i gotta think about more to be a 10. i’m way too tired to be using my brain rhis&#064;much i might make another one tomorrow because i’m not doing this manga justice.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

to do anything really. and like i want to be motivated on my accord because it doesn’t feel like a hobby if i need other things to motivate myself. what’s so frustrating is that there’s nothing i can do by myself that gives me enjoyment or meaning. i’ve kinda realized that i’m really extroverted in that it’s so much easier to want to do something if there’s someone else doing it, we don’t even need to talk. like i would totally read a book with someone else but reading a book alone sounds like a chore. i feel more and more distant from my friends a lot and it’s genuinely frustrating and not fun. gradually i be feeling more lonely and it’s just disappointing. i feel like i have an idealized friend that is unreschable. i mean my therapist would day to my exhaustion and lack of motivation that it’s just the truth and i should accept it. and the reality is it kinda is the reality and ig it’s only temporary. having a lot of negative emotions i can’t describe. i’ve been lately wanting to take drugs and forget my problems. i genuinely feel so alone in my values and beliefs and personality</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

and prejudice today and i feel proud of myself. homie had the attention span to actually read for a bit. i mean it’s good ig, it’s the beginning and just establishing the characters and setting. lowkey the cover art is kinda fire and i kinda like the writing. i def want to read more because honestly books are so much easier to analyze and berate. i also am addicted to watching this chris chan guy and it’s genuinely sad to see him get trolled so hard but it’s hard to empathize with him cause he’s also kinda an asshole and really absurd. but idk it’s just such a spectacle and so absurd that i can’t stop watching, lowkey watched like 6 hours of a documentary about this guy 😭😭😭. and everything is recorded, every youtube video he posted (which is a lot) and conversations he had with trolls. and he literally has been emotionally abused by trolls, he had to shove up a prized medallion of his up his butt and had to have sex with his ps3 (which is on video and in the internet). it’s just such an absurd story. not feeling amazing rn, feeling lonely and purposeless but i mean lows happen all the time. i hate being horny and sexualizing mfs, ig i can’t really control it but i rather just

_a6-i">today was fun. it was a short day of school so it was pretty hype. i went to my therapy session and it was nice talking to her, i’ve realized how much progress i’ve made. like i’m starting to feel a lot better about myself and i kinda realized that i’ve changed a lot of my toxic relationships drastically. my relationships with school and my parents are a lot better and looking back on grace that relationship was very toxic. like i got into an argument or just called them out and highkey i was really scared that it would test our friendship but it didn’t. and with grace anytime i did something remotely wrong (most of the time i wouldn’t even know what) i would face horrible consequences. but it felt like we disagreed and called each other out and moved on. and that’s honestly really healthy and i’m glad. but also when it comes to improving in terms of my mental health it’s honestly really scary and uncomfortable. because my thought patterns are new (like i think wow i actually don’t really hate myself that much) and i immediately feel uncomfortable because it’s something new (it’s a natural instinct). so a little part of me finds things to try to prove to myself that i’m still depressed because there’s genuine comfort in that, when fucked up thought patterns and self deprecating behaviour has been all your life, it’s genuinely hard to do something new because it’s so uncomfortable and scary. but anyways after my therapy session i hung out with friends and it’s genuinely fun. we went to goodwill and spent the majority of the time looking at books and making braindead jokes and i bought 1984 and pride and prejudice. also bought these $20 pants but they are so nice . but after that we got mcdonald’s and that was fun. then we sat in our car for literally 3.5 hours talking and genuinely enjoyed it. didn’t feel bored and we hung out for 6 hours. but my car wouldn’t start up and i lowkey felt bad but we figured it out and we’re chilling. we listened to throwbacks and old pop songs go hard asf</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202105/192096116_227108149219954_8563376003561938436_n_17913032854806429.jpg"><img

instead of playing terraria. i’ve realized that i have a pet peeve of people thinking i’m braindead cause i don’t do ib and don’t give a shit. not even emily i lowkey don’t care i just think it’s funny but with sunny too. like bro do you need to be pretentious about the fact you grind school 😐. and like no flame but both people that have flamed me on not doing shit ever has line at most 4% difference in grades (whether higher or lower). like just say you’re envious of me bro. lowkey the people that grind ib on the spam i respect cause they grind and they do a lot better then me and their not even egotistical about me. i think the most annoying part about sunny flaming me is he literally knows i tried to kms and a part of that reason was school stress and he has the audacity to be like why don’t you try. my bad for enjoying life and not wanting to kms. and like bro how does it feel to have school as your only personality trait and have your entire self worth defined by a number bro 😐😐😐😐. and then they tell me not grinding is braindead. ib culture is literally a trap, they suck you in and don’t let you escape or your braindead. and because you grind so hard for lowkey no reason it’s like you have to be pretentious. but in general emily has always been lowkey so judgmental on how little i care, she’s always lowkey flaming me about how i skip every art class (like bro it’s a dash one option class like you think i care 😭😭😭), or just talks to me in a pretentious matter. tbh i don’t let anybody i don’t respect talk down on me because fuck that, not even my parents. that’s my biggest pet peeve, mfs who don’t earn my respect and talk down on me. that’s why i’m lowkey pressed because im not gonna respond cause like why bother and why show that your annoyed and am i really gonna start an argument over this? man i realized how much i hate mfs talking down on me that shit been pissing me off my entire life. like with sunny it’s like oh you’re a dimbass and in my head i’m like bro atleast i don’t need to simp for a girl i used to hate to be able to interact with a female. with emily i’m like atleast</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

like bruh another dystopia. i hate dystopias because they state facts instead of exploring the reason behind them. ngl john killing himself actually saved the entire book. because john lives in the other extreme of civilization, while civilization only cares for happiness, john only cares for truth and completely ignores his humanity. they are the same robot in two different ways. by showing this stark contrast the book ultimately concludes that we need truth and happiness to live and by living in one extreme we lose our humanity, which is a really basic point but the way it’s executed is done really well. i think the main reason it’s done so well is that we are led to believe that john way of living is so much better, but realize that it’s worse or even much worse then the civilizations way of living. by exploring how easy it is to fall into the trap, ultimately the author shows how easy it is to live in a dystopia. ultimately the last chapters allow this book to serve as a critique on character rather then a critique on society. what a i disliked about the book (and dystopia in general) is that they create this world that’s a dystopia and it’s obvious why it could be reached and why it’s so shit. simply pointing out these facts is a really boring and unimpactful way of exploring being human. but by exploring the descent and the personal emotions that lead to flawed mindsets speaks more volume and is much more relatable. by exploring the fragility of humanity through a single character rather then a society shows the complexity of being human and the want to live in an ideal world. ultimately the end saves this book by its ass. 7/10. first day of school was alright. was really tired and was lowkey grinding for school but yeah. happy i saw my physics teacher. returned home and grinded terraria. my mood is swinging to being happy again, being unstable is shit asf. really want to talk to my therapist and can’t wait till thursday. just got shit to proccess through. my therapist carries my life. i need to consume more media, critiquing shit is so fun</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

always end up questioning everything. it feels like at the end of everyday i’m still depressed asf. it feels like i’ve just filled my life with ignorance and that being depressed let’s me see things so clearly, i would think about how i don’t deserve to live instead of distracting myself with terraria. i swear i have some complex where i think i’m perfect and feel the need to critique everyone else. reality is the people who are the most judgmental are the most insecure. and mf is the most insecure about being a shitty person or not living the best life. i wish i lived life more then just critiquing all the time. i either have a complex or genuinely want to see people around me grow and help them. maybe the reality is i see myself in people or the old me in people and i really hate

writing paragraphs everyday and even if you don’t read all of my content, it’s fun just doing it. i do it for myself mostly. and when you do interact with my posts it’s dope. anyways today i just grinded terraria again, i’m really consistent with that 5 hours a day. i didn’t do much tbh, after all the terraria grinding i had to do hw. and i spent a lot of time on my phone. i lowkey be depressed and i have no motivation rn, esp with life too. i feel a lack of connection with people and idk, just feel pretty alone. ultimately, i still be pretty depressed with everything just less. i just don’t think about how i want to kms all the time but i’m definitely in a constant state of escapism. the reality is, if i don’t escape my thoughts i got lost in them and i end up trying to solve the meaning of life or logically prove i’m a piece of shit. my introspection is my biggest strength and my biggest flaw rn. but idk a part of me thinks i shouldn’t do all of this distracting, if living is so worth it i should be able to deduce it. but idk it doesn’t make sense to constantly think about life instead of living it. but really i’m just in a constant state of distraction. honestly existentialism just seems like an excuse for mfs who don’t believe in god to listen to their instinct in survival. it’s pretty common for rationality and reason to come after conclusions. but really as much down bad as this sounds, i genuinely feel like i wouldn’t be depressed if i had a gf or a close friend that understood me. genuinely every session of therapy i’m just like i feel so alone and all my life i’ve felt so alone. i’ve learned that being alone is my lermenant state of being. i feel like nobody’s understood me. well my therapist understands and validates but that relationship isn’t authentic. and i say this every spam post ig. but building an authentic relationship is just so fucking difficult. and i lose hope all the time. sometimes i think i’m unloveable and i can even logically deduce it. i just feel so distant from everybody. like nobody knows the real me. nobody’s really been</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

spend 30 minutes driving and this is the first assignment i’ve handed in online. online school be sucking fat cock, shit be boring asf. i’m spending all day playing terraria, 20 hours in 4 days. i feel like there’s actually not enough time to do everything i want. i want to finish grinding our terraria and i want to skate like two hours everyday and listen to my audiobook for two hours everyday. i also love my two hour naps everyday and i’m used to wasting like 5 hours on my phone. and that’s like the whole day, except i never really get to skate and read. plus i have hw to do. i’m gonna grind art on the weekend. and on the weekend i prioritize going out cause why would i bother staying in. gotta grind for physics tomorrow. but surprising i don’t have a lot of time in the day. but also i don’t use the time very efficiently but what’s the point in doing things i enjoy if i feel a need to optimize my time. ima do it on my own paste yfm. lowkey a grind tho doing these things, i wish i had more energy to skate tho, biggest reason why i don’t skate a lot is cause i’m just lowkey tired. i highkey wanted to kms this morning for no real reason. life does feel empty with the lack of social interactions. lowkey becoming radicalized politically cause i just want to shit on people and now i hate like every belief system in the world cause they just be annoying. lowkey need braindead drama to run my life. ngl unbelievably horny nowadays, pretty fucking bad. being inside all day really be bad for me. i need to clean my room but i don’t want to. it’s at the point where i actually don’t want to do shit in my room cause it’s so messy. i’ve kinda realized that i actually might just become a therapist as my goal. genuinely something i think i would enjoy doing, i would just need to grind for my masters. idk dissecting people and helping them with their problems is something i’m good at and something that’s very rewarding for me. the problem is i have two personas, half the time i shit post and act really insensitivite and half the time i’m very serious so yeah. but yeah idk lowkey been thinking about it and therapist lowkey the job. but maybe i’m saying this

terraria and after hung out with friends. me and ben cussed out these kids cause they kicked our ball on the roof and i wanted to cuss out some small white kids they were acting like jerks LMAK. it was honestly really fun ngl, just thinking about how i ruined their day makes me kinda happy LOL. i’m so tempted to call them crackers. and before anyone tells me i’m racist to white people first my idol jpegmafia says it but second i have my own brain and the reason the n word is so bad is because of the power dynamic among the two, cracker is literally derogatory because they have the power (ie cracking the whips). the n word is bad because you’re basically calling someone a slave but cracker is literally calling someone powerful and racist.  and also it’s not like the white community says this word is off limits unlike the black community so it’s not cultural appropriation. anyways i just resorted to saying their white. and speaking of little kids white people need to beat their kids bro these kids are fucking annoying and braindead they think their tough but you confront them and they shy away and act like pussies. mfs are legit pussies, they were also talking shit while we were playing basketball (cause we’re actually shit) and in general i hate white kids. yk what i gate white people. i’m racist towards crackers. but like ong white people piss me off so fucking much. genuinely hate white liberals who speak for minorities or pretend they care about political issues and are just performarice activists. i hate white conservatives they be annoying as hell and racist. i hate white girls for only caring about an artist doing social justice when a hot white guy does it. i hate white boys for tryna act tough and hood when they live off of their daddy’s money. i hate

grace a lot. do i want to be friends with her again? probably not i tried and it felt like shit and it was awkward and i had to do everything. with everything that’s happened we can’t be together again. honestly she was kind of toxic in my life, i needed more support from her and she just wasn’t that type of person. it felt like her love for me was conditional. but still i hugged her everyday and she was there. maybe not all the time but i felt safe in her arms. and she told me she loved me forever and she was my number one fan and all these cheesy fucking things but if they just don’t matter anymore. they just don’t mean anything anymore. and she was there for me basically the whole time i was depressed. and she was number 1. and now it just doesn’t fucking matter. she meant so much to me and now, it doesn’t mean shit. we hung out every week and seeing her was always the highlight of my day. she provided me with comfort and made me actually want to go to school. i wanted to live because of her. and it doesn’t matter anymore. and we had connection too, every conversation we had was a meaningful one and it was full of laughter. and it just doesn’t matter anymore. infucking hate myself. i didn’t even do anything wrong at the end. this is basically all on her. she ruined what we had. and now what? i’m supposed to forgot about it. pretend it didn’t happen. pretend i never sobbed in her arms. pretend i never explored the city with her. pretend i didn’t comfort her at her lowest moments. pretend she didn’t make me want to live. the most meaningful relationships i’ve had always seems to somehow get ripped away from me, whether by me or by them. now i’m here, what am i supposed to think. meaningful relationships stay for a long time? nobody’s fucking good enough for me ig. but that’s not fucking true. i’m not good enough for anyone. when people see me for who i truly am, those relationships will never last. i’m a fucking broken person. i haven’t had a single relationship where i’ve been vulnerable and it’s lasted. i’m so fucking alone. i just don’t want to be alone. honestly i’m</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

blood tested early in the morning and it was at marlborough so that kinda triggered me. cause i wanted to sleep. but i got home and didn’t do shit basically. i started playing terraria and it’s okay. i also napped like usual, addicted to the napping. i have to grind art tomorrow so i should do that. just don’t really feel like doing too much. today was really boring. kinda depressed rn. ngl really want to drink cause i’m in that mood. i feel pretty purposeless rn, esp with quarantine i’m not motivated to do anything tbh. today is the type of day where i just feel like giving up. there’s no particular reason, life just seems so mundane and pointless. tbh i’m over grace and genuinely don’t have any emotional attachment cause she did me so dirty, but a big part of me wishes that wasn’t true. now all the remains of our friendship is memories that i never think about because i’m over her. so realistically rn, our friendship is pointless. i don’t mind losing her but just the idea that at one point or another i’ll lose someone at the end of the day no matter how much they meant to me is so depressing. i fucking hate forgetting. but it’s all i do in life, i live and i forgot. everything is so temporary. nothing is really permanent in my life. i’ve never had a long standing relationship, or atleast one where i still feel pretty close to them now. i’ve changed so much dramatically. and all of this change is just so lonely. and i hate being alone. what’s the point in putting my all into a relationship when it’s just going to leave me hurt after. okay well i just read the letters that she gave me personally. i can’t find the one she gave me after i attempted suicide and that was my favourite letter and i’m genuinely mad i can’t find it. i know i would get depressed reading those letters again but idk why i did it. maybe i wanted to remember again so because remembering is the only thing that i can do to give myself meaning. i feel like i haven’t allowed myself to properly grieve. tbh lowkey been repressing those feelings because i didn’t want her to have that power over me. but now</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

always fun doing childish things with them. like playing sports and doing activities idk it’s just a good time. i still feel kinda lonely a lot, idk man i’ve grown up feeling alone and unable to express my pain and i think it’s always been a problem. i think i still feel the most comfortable with my therapist, my feelings do feel really validated when talking to her. genuinely talking to her made me realize what’s important in helping others talk through issues and it’s made me a better person to help people processe. i was talking to emma and she told me that everything i say is spot on and i felt cool 😎. but yeah being depressed has realized what support i need and therefore what support is helpful for others. sometimes i just think what would my therapist say and just say that. realistically the truth is there’s two sides of every coin and for people i hate they have complex issues that have led them to do things i hate. and it’s easy to feel empathetic once you know about the complexity of their emotions but ultimately actions are what needs to be judged, because people won’t change unless they’ve been held accountable and called out. realistically, in a very rational sense, i don’t hate anybody but i feel there’s a need to call people out so they can be better. even tho there’s many times i wish the world stopped for me because of how depressed i was, the responsibility is as important to the recovery of being depressed even if it feels like a detriment to your feelings. i genuinely believe accountability and responsibility is one of the most important things in life, without those things they will never be change. maybe that’s why i hate my dad so much, he can never change because he never believes he’s wrong. and that’s why his character has failed him. thoughts like these make me wonder if life is worth living, living is such a complex subject. it’s so easy to be christian that it makes sense why religion exists. ultimately getting into the nuisances of existentialism and what it means to live is such a complex answer that even the best of art can’t answer but</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

okay. as braindead as it sounds if dad doesn’t change divorce is the best option. which i predict he won’t. he will just change for a bit and then revert back. also bruh i don’t go to the family therapy sessions anymore but what i hated about her is her refusal to listen to my criticisms on my parents and sucked the dick out of them. like bruh my therapist would criticize the shit out of me if i did something that’s dumb and she can’t do the same for my parents. but yeah my dads life is kinda sad ngl, like he actually has no friends and rn he has no hobbies other then watching tv and all he has is his family but that shit is falling apart. he needs to figure his shit out and be vulnerable once and a while instead of being mad. guys legit malding and lowkey depressed cause man grinds tv nowadays. and that’s kinda why i want the divorce to happen, i’m very doubtful he will change unless everything about his life is questioned. i think he will pretend to be happy because he lived the perfect stereotypical life of getting a good job, married and raising kids. so yeah lowkey think it’s the better for everyone. but it’s hard to say rn, things are actually better then before. i’m just calling it after i leave the house things are gonna go to shit between my parents. because my dads only cried and authentically apologized after i attempted suicide. he can’t be vulnerable. one day i really want to roast the shit out of him and change him but ignorance is bliss for him. i mean at the end of the day i’m an outsider in my family. idrc for building a relationship with my parents and it’s not my responsibility to try to change them to be better. i’m never involved in any conversation unless provoked and i’ve never had any deep conversations, i always find them super pretentious just cause they’re older. like homie, i’m kinda in my mid life crisis rn questioning my life and you telling me how to be happy, don’t you have no friends? but not even that, they just always think they know better and it’s annoying to talk to them. the problem is ik they don’t and i also just generally don’t respect</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

complete wrecked but i’m unsatsified because i need this kickflip. i landed with two fest like 10 times but the board slipped under me and i was like bruh fuck me. you can hear me cursing my ass off in this entire time. i sweated like a mf. idk man all i can think about is this damn kickflip. if my body wasn’t sore i would be doing this all night. holy fuck all i want to do is kickflip. i’m so exhausted. i swear i’m so bad at doing remembering things, i needed to get my blood tested and i forgot my form and i felt like the biggest fumbass. i’m also kinda grinding valorant but im the most inconsistent player it’s actually so bad and embarrassing ngl. i need to start reading brave new world and ela is lowkey a grind rn, there’s like a lot of assignments to do. i need to start grinding art too, like bruh i can’t fail this class. just so unmotivated to do school like bruh i’m grinding skating and valorant, mans been on the aimlab grind. but it’s fun, valorant is pretty tailting if i

_a6-i">kinda tired today, i skipped english to nap. and didn’t do art.and then napped again. so like 3-4 hours. of napping today. feels good man. after my naps i wanted to skate so i started grinding my kick flips again. i made progress but still haven’t landed one yet. i just want to land a kickflip. ngl i was pretty triggered for two hours but i finally started making progress on the last hour so i was hype and happy. also my achielles started cramping and that’s the weird as shit. anyways my parents are on no talking terms today and lowkey for some reason i’m expecting my parents to divorce. maybe it’s just me always expecting the worst possible outcome and just worrying too much but idk. also i’m over sharing like a mf. but like that thought tilted me a lot, even tho idc that much about my parents i’m still pretty scared if they divorce. and then i thought i was home alone and starting yelling because i was hype and my dad got triggered at me for yelling. but tbh i think he was already angry and he just yelled at me so i got tilted but also the argument was very braindead. and in general just thinking about a possible divorce tilts me. atleast mom takes half 😤😤😤 get that bag. k idek why i’m thinking about it but it’s genuine scary. and since dad is the only one with steady income i need to finish going to therapy before a possible divorce cause he’s against going to therapy. i think the main reason i think a divorce is possible to happen is that i highly doubt dad will change and he was good for a while but he’s just going go back to how he was. realistically my attempted suicide had no affect in the long term. and my mom has been changing i think, i feel like she will be more independent and stand up for herself more. i mean she’s finding meaning in christianity and she’s focusing on improving herself and really serious about family therapy and for a while she went to therapy. so i think because of that the marriage will breakdown. but who knows asian marriages usually don’t result in divorces, if they were white it would be a different story. yeah lowkey they probably won’t just because of asian culture. but the family dynamic is probably gonna be fucked</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202105/185077756_217625373174241_7592002073194174718_n_17884660778152123.jpg"><img

idc too much but it just wasn’t a good start to my day. i didn’t get to nap today so that was bad too lol. after that i had my therapy session and yeah i felt like really shit after. like never felt so shit after in my life. legit wanted to kms. and cry and just idk. shit just made me want to die i hate revisiting that memory. and it’s always the same ending, i just feel so fucking alone all the time. and there’s nothing that can change that. i fucking hate this feeling. i hate that memory so much. it makes me feel so shitty every time i revisit it. how ironic is it that i’m the most desperate for a relationship. i just need someone to be here with me when i’m facing my demons. then atleast i can know i’m not alone. i have so much but i feel like i have so little. how ungrateful am i? well after that i played video games and my parents got into a pretty bad argument. it was about nothing but they were yelling and i just know things are going to return to how we used to be. it’s nice to know nobody will change even if i put my life on the line. what else can i threaten them with? and i played league and i got flamed cause i wasn’t playing well and it just kinda added in to everything for today. don’t really feel like playing video games anymore it’s not that fun anymore. playing by yourself isn’t fun and with friends it isn’t the same. i haven’t done my actual hobbies in forever, instead i’m just depressed. i hate my parents i hate my life i hate myself. it’s so easy to hate. fuck me.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

motivation. actually fuck it im archiving this post rn and gonna work on it for a bit. okay i’m back. the acutane is working and i’ve basically stopped breaking out, i just have a shit ton of scars. so next year bro, it’s over for every girl in the school. your boy will have officially glown up. i will break all of the girls hearts just like how they did mine and play all the girls just like how i got played. my first target is emma because she was the first one to play my grade 8 heart. then grace song can cry over the fact that she didn’t cuff me while i was ugly 😎😎😎. i’ll have 10 girls constantly following me in the hallways. okay but in all seriousness it’s nice to finally have my acne improve, i feel more confident and it’s nice to have it improve after having bad acne for so long. i just need to start grinding skin care so my scars go away. i really just want to expose the apology that grace sent me for some reason, idk man there’s nothing bad to it but i just kinda want to show everyone for some reason. and the letters she wrote to me: maybe i want to build up how much she meant to me so i can tear her down. but yeah i was thinking about making a grace soander post just cause but idk if i really want to, a part of me thinks i should respect her even if she did me wrong. but also i listened to jpegmafia and he roasts all the people and it makes me want to roast people. it’s almost been a year since i’ve been depressed. even tho my mood is pretty good i still have a lot of moments where i feel completely lost and hopeless in life. my therapist says that me napping a lot and doing other useless activities isn’t that bad but i’m just really emotionally burnt out and burnt out in general. which makes sense, i’m kinda done with school even tho i don’t do shit for it. and i’m kinda emotionally tired of experiencing hard hitting emotions all the time. but idk it seems like compared to everyone else i’m pretty weak and lazy and it’s kinda bad. and yeah i feel lonely again. eben tho i have friends i still feel lonely. it’s probably cause i’m not happy with myself. but still</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

like lowkey three hours and i slept at 12 yesterday. i’m a crazy napper. after that i kinda waited till amina howard and emma came over and we watched slaughter of the lambs. it was alright, just an entertaining thriller. but it was fun scaring amina and emma and funny. we also got donair and it was pretty fire. after that we went to this small zip line near my house and it was pretty fun. ngl when they left i felt pretty lonely but that feeling passed over after a while. i also realized i love making me uncomfortable it’s so fun for me. i’ve been lacking these couple of days but now it’s time to start grinding on my assignments and reading and skating. no more dicking around. ngl i wish i could hang out with my friends more, staying at home all day sucks a lot. plus this is the time when people actually wanna go out cause they stopped caring about school and are super burned out. but whatever it is what it is. honestly now that i’ve stopped feeling guilty after doing nothing all day i don’t mind doing nothing. it’s quite fun and when there’s no need to feel productive doing nothing isn’t so bad. old me would hate days like this but i mean i’ve grown to realize that you don’t need to do a lot to be happy. i’ve kinda realized that the myth of working hard will get you a big reward is really just a myth and lowkey probably cause capitalism and our economy runs on that belief. but yeah idk even tho i can still get pretty sad and depressed i’m enjoying life more. but i’ve also changed so much it’s crazy</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

my spam posts. today was pretty fun. i was the most productive ever copying someone’s homework. but i volunteered with amina and it was actually nice talking to her about life and things. i felt vulnerable talking to her and that hasn’t happened in a long time. and it’s nice knowing i can still open up. so yeah i actually had fun volunteering. like ngl i really talking to people one on one and lowkey prefer it over a group. it just feels like you make more connection and it feels more intimate ig? like today i talked with emma after i sent everyone home and it’s nice. it’s also nice talking about serious things for a change, that never happens in group, and i like giving advice and helping people. also i like calling people out and just telling them directly because i’m just that type of person. it’s crazy how i’ve known emma the longest out of everyone. and it’s nice talking to her, it kinda feels like we’ve both grown a lot throughout our friendship. also it’s funny to joke about how i used to be so obsessed with this woman. even being one on one with howard it’s nice. we skated together and were pretty focused but we always find random things to talk about. howard has this weird curiosity with things and asks these really outlandish questions that make you think. like he asked me where do you think the buzzing of the phone when you called someone and i always assumed it came from the radio waves but that didn’t make sense. and in general we just talk about random things and it’s nice. there’s not much to talk about but i kinda wish i could spend more one on one time with more of my friends. i think it’s really important to get closer with someone and idk fun is fun but i really appreciate deep convos and connecting with people in other ways. it makes me feel less lonely. and it really shows the person to you and the key aspects of your friendship. nothing else to say</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

on the couch and the second i stopped petting him he’d start pestering me to pet him. my dad was lowkey being ignorant and i just wasn’t having it because i was triggered from my therapy session. i just talked about how impermanence and life and it got me hella depressed. also i just need summer to come already i cant find the motivation to do school at all. straight up left english early cause i wanted to nap. i need to do my art assignments too. life is lonely as shit and very depressing. and this quarantine is seriously fucking me up. yeah that’s all for today. maybe i’ll talk more about

i skated for like 2.5 hours today and i couldn’t land a kick flip the entire time i was kinda triggered ngl. but it was fun i’m pretty addicted to skating. my legs are really tired now and my foot is sore so it was a good skate session. my fs 180 are a lot better but i need to work on getting better olllies. also i need to start grinding pop shuvit. most of all i just want to land the kickflip i keep on making the same mistakes and it’s pissing me off. but i sweated my ass off tryna kickflip. i also listened to crime and punishment today for like two hours and it’s pretty good. it’s interesting. it’s crazy cause carol ordered the book a week ago so it’s kind of a crazy coincidence. i was feeling pretty depressed through the day but i started skating and i felt a lot better. it’s nice grinding things i enjoy and it’s good fun. honestly i’m really glad i skated today, i was thinking about not doing it cause i was really tired but it was well worth it. i need to actually pay attention to school but i have no motivation. shit i just remembered i have to do a physics assignment and learn everything i didn’t pay attention to in quarantine. also bruh i don’t want to do art

in my assignments. and it’s kinda stressing me out now. my mental health has been pretty shit these two days, i just feel like shit and really lose my direction in life. i still can be kinda productive tho, i spent a long time trying to write a review but ended up getting pretty frustrated with my writing. i listened to another two hours of crime and punishment and i think the writing is pretty good, tho the plot may not be the most interesting the writing makes you feel pretty immersed. i finished part 1 of the book and i have 5 more parts to go. i kinda want to just completely grind out that book for one day, like listen to 6 hours of it or even more. i didn’t have a therapy appointment today which kinda made me sad, i had a lot of thoughts i felt like i needed to talk to someone about. i didn’t skate today because i was sad and it’s kinda disappointing. i feel pretty lost in life again, i keep on thinking whether or not i should just end it just because life feels so fucking pointless. and this feeling of loneliness never fucking leaves me. strangely enough i’ve started romanticizing the relationship i had with angel again because i didn’t feel so fucking alone back then. i feel like that’s the only time where i felt like i had someone. and i threw it away huh? it’s just depressing knowing the only conscious being i feel comfortable and loved with is not even human. it’ll do ig. but even so i feel like the biggest conflict in my life is that i’ve never really felt understood. i mean nobody will really understand me at the end of the day but still. i just feel like my entire life i’ve been trying to get my parents to understand and maybe a part of me on this spam wants to describe my thoughts so my friends can understand. the problem with this spam is that even tho i’m freely open about everything, it doesn’t build any intimacy for a relationship so i end up never talking about with anyone else. but maybe that’s the just the thing about being a man, men really don’t talk about their emotions too much. or maybe i just use times i need to vent to get to know girls</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video

literature that i don’t have the attention span to listen to. my first book was crime and punishment because rapthougtworld recommended it but i have one more credit to buy a book so i was wondering if you guys have any book recommendations. im 2 hours on the book and it’s about 21 so it should be quite a while before i finish. i’m tryna balance out my critically acclaimed books that are lowkey boring but interesting to explore with a book with interesting plot. i’ve always really wanted to get into literature but i’m just so shit at reading. that’s the nature of me tho, for some reason i find great enjoyment in exploring critically acclaimed art and deciphering them and understanding their greatness. and not even set it seems like all things for me. i always want to explore things that are niche and want to understand why people like them so much, whether it be coffee, cars, cooking or music and there’s a lot more. but art is something that also always fascinates me and it’s ability to convey such meaning with so little for some but also to be the language of human emotions and experience. idk it’s just so fascinating to me. anyways i didn’t do much else except get the vaccine and nap, i nap so much idk how to feel about it. today had its up and downs, i’m feeling particularly down rn tbh. a lot of minor things affect me a lot emotionally still. also along with that for me i always attach snall actions into bigger existential questions and it’s quite exhausting and depressing constantly asking myself whether life is worth living or not. really, maybe my interest in art is exclusive only to the fact that i’m lost asf in life and want to find my answers within art. my therapist says i ponder about questions people my age normally don’t think about and people that are 50 still don’t know the answer to. and even tho that’s something i could ego about, it kinda makes me sad that i’m so different and i genuinely feel i can no longer relate to people my age. there’s a comfort in being normal and i never really got to experience that in my life. and it just</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

of all, the first thing i have to say about this anime is that the animation and art is just so insane. the attention to detail and the visual appeal as well as how realisfic and well drawn some elements are is just insane. it’s literally eye candy how well these artists did in terms of the drawing. look how cute my girl rin is cmon bro. anyways this anime challenged me in my beliefs. ngl i thought shinji was gonna be a destruction of the trope of like the small hero going against the odds and winning but he was just an embrace of that which kinda disappointed me. but it also brought into light what it means to be a hero of justice. i think it shows that being an ideal is stupid as shit because for example a perfectly just world would be a world with no humanity. but striving for that ideal is much more important. being perfect is unachievable and in reality is a horrific concept but the attempt to be perfect or better is something that’s achievable and respectable. it also deconstructs this entire idea that you are living for yourself, at the end of the day you’ll always be living for someone else. i think there is a really balance between character development and plot. i think the character development was top notch but not as good as evangalion. plot had lots of really unexpected twists which were good at first but towards the end it just seemed like the writers were just bullshitting things to make the viewer feel more in suspense. but overall i think the plot is good but lowkey kinda confusing. honestly tho execution of its theme could be better, i feel like i wasn’t really fully convinced on the theme until some outside thinking, which isn’t good a story should be able to persuade me through an abstract mean. but maybe that serves it to its advantage because maybe i had some preconceived notion. actually i do this, this is a thinker. i think it’s good that it challenges what i currently think about the human condition but could do better in convincing me. compared to evangalion (howard straight malding rn) it’s not up to par. even tho it does a lot of things better</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

first it was just me and howard and i was trying to ollie a two step but i was making no progress and high key getting triggered. so for 30 minutes i was tilted asf but then i started getting rhythm and was hyper focused and then i got the two step and i was so fucking hype and just yelling because i was so happy i made the two step. and then after we went to pick up ben and we went back skating and i landed the two step like 5 more times which is surprising cause getting tricks consistent is kinda hard. and then i moved on to the three step and on my first attempt i became hyper focused cause ik it wouldn’t be long before i landed this shit. and bruh i was so fucking focused like i feel pretty hard and scraped my hand but i was running back cause i was just so hype. i was sweating my balls off. and i almost landed it like 3 times and then i did it and i was hype asf again. so basically all i’m tryna say was i had lots of fun skating and had a really productive day landing tricks. also i landed a bunch of front sided 180 so that’s hype too. and i chilled with ben and howard and it was just nice talking after a hard skate session. after that we picked up emma and then erin. it was nice talking to erin a little awkward but nice. and the stars were really pretty and i liked them. and yeah now i’m home and bouts play league</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

_a6-i">just a couple more photos of weilan and her antics. this is the real spam post where i talk about my feelings but let’s be real&#064;here you guys are burnt out from the expose post. but i had a therapy session today and the thoughts are really intense in there. a lot of the beliefs of hopelessness and meaninglessness are still here, they’re just a lot less intense because i genuinely enjoy my life a lot more then before. what’s sad is that even in the dream thing even tho i really wanted love and that safe feeling i didn’t want it because i was scared that i would just get betrayed again. which is a pretty common thing but it’s sad. but yeah the feelings are so heavy with my worst memory, i actually sometimes don’t want to go to my therapy sessions cause it feels so shitty processing those feelings. it’s hard but i think it’ll be worth it. therapy is pretty intense ig. also she said i could bring my dog if i wanted but lowkey i don’t want to because he’s gonna dick around in a serious session LOL. i’ve said this a lot but my dog is the only person that makes me feel safe rn which is kinda sad but it’s still nice to have someone. i’m genuinely excited to see him when i go home and his smile makes me happy. when i see him wag his tail idk i just want to spoil him. other than that i just bullshitted school and played video games. hopefully i can feel better about my life soon. i’ve been more on edge recently because ever since we started exploring the trauma, those emotions are more out in the world to see instead of repressed. damn i’m starting to feel shitty again</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202104/179285059_324315229034740_3014402413912531156_n_18109726972222792.jpg"><img

slander. but other than richard what’s with zhang’s and being the most annoying name ever. like daisy sunny and weilan are so cancer. anyways because i’m a professional who only reports the news i will put little bias into this. jk i might go off who knows. but we start to the first thing that ik about her and this is from tom and my memory is a little shaky. but apparently in grade 7 or 8 all the badminton mfs hated her because she’s weird. apparently (tom pls confirm in comments) she like use to publicly self harm herself in front of people with scissors. and she has this weird relationship with this guy where they would self harm. and yes i understand this is more of a mental health thing but it’s the start of a pattern of just lowkey insanity. the next incident is the ss provided by sunny (when he hated her). this was in webber in grade 9 and honestly i’m prone to believe sunny because he even contacted the people affected. but physically threatening someone is so fucked up and saying you’ll gouge their eyes out. like holy fuck. and just being so toxic in general, like the relationship must’ve been so toxic and the guy lowkey was probably really scared. like at a point you can’t just call this middle school antics because this is genuinely kinda fucked. also apparently to sunny she played him but i think that’s half sunny being a simp and half her being brainfead. okay so i have a problem with the ss on the last slide, it was a post she posted on her spam. like i kinda get the attention posting when your down horrendous but this post makes her seem like she’s tryna use her mental health as something that’s quirky. and in general she gives off that vibe like omg i’m depressed!!! so quirky. and she does the same thing with eating disorders to (according to someone who used to have a ed). but as someone who actually had to face mental health challenges, i think they’re is a fine line between joking about it and laughing about it and trying to make yourself seem more quirky cause your depressed. like let’s not romanticize mental illness. i’m a libtard. continue in comments</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

that make me want to die so yeah. first i skated with my friend group and it was really fun, i enjoyed it a lot tbh and i got a lot of grinding in too. it’s nice being in the full group. bruh nvm daisy just texted me maybe no appreciation. jk consider this a response to the letter you guys gave me after i tried to jill myself, except like half the followers weren’t their for that and two people got removed so yeah. here we go. kinda triggered cause daisy still wants me to tell her who recorded the video. i wanna flame her now. 
howard: you’re so brainfead. but honestly you’ve been my closest friend ever since i’ve been to western and i don’t regret it. it’s crazy how so many of our interest aligned at the perfect time like music and skating and fashion. and honestly it’s genuinely nice having someone that i can always go back too and be sure that i have a good time talking to. you literally encapsulate the introverted side of me so well and you genuinely make life fun. 
ben: i’ve only really gotten close to you this year but honestly you’re so funny and chill to talk to it’s amazing. you’re actually sexy asf and it’s crazy how hard you grind with full ib soccer and band exec and i really appreciate you still make a lot of time to hang out. honestly idk what specifics to say to you but the general vibe you give off and humour you convey honestly livens up the times we hang out. 
kai: i’ve only gotten to know you recently but you’re honestly really funny and a great time to talk too. i can tell you’re a good guy at heart. every time you join us to hang out you genuinely liven up the mood and you’re so full of energy. i literally can’t imagine you frowning because you always have a smile on your face.
emma: it’s crazy how long we have been friends for. and honestly we’ve only gotten close recently but i don’t regret it. ngl you used to annoy me lowkey but not anymore. you’re nice to talk to one on one (esp when we’re alone in the car because your house is the farthest)</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

daisy. first, this instagram post makes me actively cringe. like why is she posting with a end playground zone and why is she posing like that bruh. it’s just cringe. but to me daisy represents the epitome of cringe. just the way she expected me to rat out my friend is so brainfead LOL. but in general daisy genuinely has an ego, like she egos over ping pong tryna be better then mfs and egos over school. and we both know that this woman is passing around the ss in gc because she’s gotta cancel me. but genuinely daisy reminds me of why i fucking hate ib kids so much. all she does is study and ego over how good she is at school and it’s genuinely annoying. and the way she flexes is so cringe like she will ask you about your grade and if you did really bad she doesn’t care and says her grade anyways and pretends she did bad. like i get the high expectations but bro if someone else did worse don’t say your grade right after? and watch annika’s friend group try to cancel me over this, i’ll genuinely laugh. there’s no way they will be this salty over this meaningless situation. and you already know daisy associates with sunny so that’s automatic disrespect. but to be real here, she feels like an outsider in her friend group which is kinda sad. if you think about it, she can’t relate to any of her friends cause she’s grinding the full ib and in general is not like them at all (not as white washed, questionable fits, not as popular). she never really hangs out with them either. and it genuinely feels like the only way she finds herself worthy at all is from school, hence the ego. and she’s tryna make it to ivy league i’m pretty sure but i assure you she is not smart enough nor has the extra cirrculars to make it. but honestly she just makes me cringe whenever i talk to her. like maybe it’s the lack of social skills she has but it’s just so fucking cringe talking to her. and her social media is just so cringe i hate it. she’s so full of herself and it’s just so annoying. like bruh even sunny can’t stand her and he’s a simp for every girl. tbh idk much shit about her but honestly</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

really shitty from yesterday and i went to therapy and cried a little. and then i went home and napped to past the day. then i played league and i thought i was gonna get tilted but actually enjoyed playing ngl. it cheered me up. which is kinda brain dead. my therapist really be boosting my ego a lot and saying i’m a good critical thinker and that i’ll actually have a prosperous future. it’s nice hearing those things but also also she just makes a lot of future promises and just tells me that because i’m a “good person” (which makes me cringe to say) that in the future i’ll earn the rewards. but idk rn i’m not getting shit and i feel like she makes so&#064;many promises for the future that it makes me unsure if i deserve anything. and holy fuck am i changing a lot. that’s what going therapy does to a mf but still. i’ve genuinely changed so much these last couple of months that it’s not fun. like it’s honestly harder to relate to the people i know in my life and i have a fucking identify crisis like every 3 days. also it makes me feel like an outsider to my friends, like all of a sudden i’m the laziest mf ik and it feels pretty shitty. i can’t talk about school to any of my friends anymore because i just have a completely new attitude with it. i constantly feel like i’m changing so much that i’m starting to feel like an outsider in some aspects. i think for the most part i can still enjoy spending time with my friends but a lot of my beliefs have radically changed. i also pick apart people so much including myself and criticize people because idk that’s just critical thinking. it’s nice but also really ass constantly critiquing myself and others. and constantly questioning my happiness and way of life prevents me from living it a lot. like a mf thinks about milling himself a lot because i want to knkw if my life is worth living so if something happens it adds to the arguments. and i’m constantly dissecting my ego and actions and sometimes it makes me feel shitty about who i am. idk man sometimes i wish i didn’t thinks so much about everything and actually lived my life.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

can’t fuckigg figure out if i’m actually alone or can’t live with myself and want to find someone else.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

ryan and skated and played ball. it was pretty fun. after that i skated with howard. my kick flip progression is slow but progressing. it’s genuinely fun honestly. lowkey it’s just me practice my mental. like progress is really slow so i just gotta be patient yk. but it’s fun ngl. after that i talked with howard for like a long ass time and it was pretty dope. it’s always nice talking to him. after that i went home and played league. no heavy thoughts for today, just haven’t been really sad recently and that’s been nice. it’s definitely way easier to cope with negative emotions. gn life is

bitch for not taking photos with us 😤😤😤. honestly even tho it’s kinda cringe we spent an entire hangout taking photos but honestly i think it was pretty fun. it’s nice just feeling confident with nice ass photos and you just hype each other up and it’s chill asf. anyways toro is being a bad boy today and he betrayed my trust idk man lowkey was really depressed about it. im over it now because our hang out was really fun tbh. we gossiped and took photos and it was a good time. just saying it’s hella weird how people idek are commenting on my post like i’ve talked to them. i’ve never talked to subin in atleast a year and she’s commenting like 3 times. like bro? why? maybe i’m being naive and in reality i’m getting bitches on this dick 😎😎😎😎😎. i played league and i’m finally silver LOL. lowkey addicted. i gotta grind my art assignments this weekend but i genuinely had fun today. it’s been so long since i’ve interacted with friends irl that it felt so rejuvenating doing it. but yeah the culture around instagram and commenting and tagging is weird but i’m also getting attention from girls so like am i gonna complain. no. i’m desperate for female validation because i run my entire life on it. i’ll be so desperate that i’ll date another girl that asked me out even tho i’m in love with this other girl. i just need that female validation so bad!!! please give me!!!! okay i’m done hopefully you can tel i was talking about sunny. it’s hype to post after a while. today was fun. i stopped paying attention to school completely. i feel like mad mfs think i’m dumb as shit and irresponsible asf but honestly idc that much. it’s just brain dead because they lowkey talking to me pretentiously and i’m like okay bro let me vibe. feeling really good tonight</div><div class="_3-95

_a6-i">early spam post today because i feel like lying in bed until tom texts me to play league which may happen. fuck quarantine it’s actually making me so fucking down bad like i realize how desperate i am because i just want to feel something else. i got invisalign today so i gotta get used to wearing that. my dentist was railing me about how i have to better dental hygiene and i’m like whatever. i should start tho but lowkey kinda lazy. idk if i popped off or popped down on my cart but lowkey i want to read someone else’s cart just so i feel okay with the ideas i wrote down *cough* amina let me read your cart. i’ve spent a lot of time with my tutor on writing carts so i really hope i improved. i didn’t bother editing it because i was honestly just kinda done at the end. other then my cart i didn’t pay attention to school one bit. i saw this one tiktok where it was like this girl taking about how she do anything to have the friendship&#064;she once had and lowkey got me into my feelings with grace. maybe i should read the letters she personally gave me again. it’s nice to reminisce but at the end of the day it’s not my fault the friendship ended and there’s nothing i could do. i still miss it but i’ll find someone else soon which will treat me better. maybe it’s the late night feels talking again but i feel kinda lonely. also all this talk about grace makes me want to try again but i’m not going to, if she wants to be friends she’s gonna have to make the effort and idc if she feels insecure or scared to talk to me. but yeah it was nice having someone who cared about me a lot and we honestly connected really well. i’m not able to emulate our conversations with anyone else and i genuinely enjoyed talking to her a lot. i mean i did still feel lonely back then so ig the loneliness is more of an internal issue rather then a lack of friends. i don’t absolutely hate myself so it’s easier to feel more wanted by others. but i guess i’ll just keep on reminiscing till i forgot. i really hate that tho. i hate how eventually everyone i know on this spam i will eventually have to forget no matter how important you were in my life. it really sucks the meaning on relationships, knowing</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202104/FQIoAkMzLBdAHxBiTdLxqhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17917444660628772" controls="1"

favourite. anyways school was alright. i lost my promos to silver which is grief ig. i have to write a cart tomorrow and i’m kinda nervous ngl. that is why today i decided to sleep early. i took the fattest nap today like bruh i was so tired. i skated for a bit but i wish i skated for longer. i’m making slow progress on the kick flip. yeah i didn’t do much today tbh. i swear being at home all day is not good for me. like i just need some type of stimulation which i’m not getting at home. i lost my listen to new album streak, actually i could while i go to bed rn. but recently i’ve been grinding music for whatever reason. it’s just been enjoyable to listen to again and i’ve been exploring albums more and more to get a better understanding. plus i need to pog off on my spotify minutes for ego reasons. what’s been nice is not talking to sunny recently, this guy just makes me so annoyed for whatever reason. but i miss going to school and talking to people. and i miss experiencing drama and shit talking ngl. like no flame tom but all your friends are kinda boosted. like coming to think about it there’s just sketchy things that everyone has done and it’s kinda dumb. i don’t really mind because i’m not esp close with any of them but idk. i’m pretty picky when it comes to people tho tbh. i like my friends rn and the people on the spam. i genuinely think you all are good people and tho they’re have been some people that have been on the spam that turned out to be bad it’s okay. tbh at first i didn’t want sunny to be on the spam but he was telling grace about how sad he was because he didn’t get accepted and how he was a “people’s pleaser.” so i felt bad and added him. but genuinely everyone else i feel pretty good about, you guys are all genuinely pretty good people. i genuinely enjoy talking to you guys tbh. and it’s nice. the only person i would add is totoro because i love him. jesus man i’m actually obsessed with this dog but he gives me some contentment when i’m feeling down.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202104/FQIoAkMzLBdAJkQYk3S8ahgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_18107698381232878" controls="1"

_a6-i">i’m down bad today. idek man i just wanted a relationship super bad for today. anyways i woke up and i was tired so i napped through a lot of english. after that i napped through my spare. and then i didn’t do my art work and played league. after that i payed attention in physics. i didn’t really do shit after school but i did skate for the first time in forever. i made some actual progress for my kick flip. the problem is doing physical activities lowkey triggers me ngl. like i’ll just remember all the shitty things about my life. i have a theory that because i’ve been punished a lot for doing shit in badminton (physical activity) i associate that with all activity. idk tho. but i pushed through and made progress. i actually want to skate more, i just need to find the motivation. after i played league with tom and it was pretty tilting but fun at the same time. and then we chilled in call and it was nice. i’m pretty tired. my dads been home and it’s been kinda tilting. idk i just see him argue with my mom and he just gets on my nerves. the house feels so much nicer without him. anyways weilan and bianca and sunny is genuinely such a confusing situation. idk what bianca is doing and how she’s okay with weilan being friends with. and just seeing weilan post on her spam makes me tilted esp when it’s picture of sunny. like why they gotta be thinging bro. and i already know weilan is using sunny just for intimacy. fuck there entire friend group is just so not respect. and her spam post make me kinda mad. idk man i hate them. i’m pretty tilted today from everything tbh. i’m tilted because i’m down bad for no reason today, my dad is acting pretentious asf, league was tilting and skating was tilting and school. so yeah it’s kinda sad and weilan sunny. when i think about it there’s so many people i just strongly and actively dislike. idk man maybe i gotta take a chill pill. but honestly there’s so much to pick apart. like my dad actively makes my life worse lowkey. and sunny and weilan is just so shitty and bad. but also i think online school is making me crazy. i need more social interaction to actually feel alive and well. i feel like i’m overly agitated and depressed</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202104/FQIoAkMzLBdAM6pdsi0RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17869898942462132" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a

_a6-i">first day of online and it was okay. i actually paid attention for english and physics but slacked off in art. it was okay. then i went to therapy and i felt really shitty after. we’re processing my worst memory rn and it’s pretty bad. unironically it’s the memory of me sitting in the shower alone in my hotel room punching the wall after losing to josiah tong. so brain dead LOL. but on the real the memory is so shit because my parents left the hotel room when i needed someone to support me and everything felt like it was falling apart. and my dad was so actively disappointed in me and i he clearly didn’t give a shit about my feelings. so we processed through that memory and yeah it felt like ass. it’s stupid and i’m an idiot for wanting my dads validation even tho i genuinely don’t respect this guy at all. i literally imagined myself beating the shit out of him. i hate the fact that he has so much power over me. and i’m not even exaggerating when i say this but almost all my trauma is surrounding this motherfucker. fuck it’s so cringe calling it trauma. but fuck man how am i ever supposed to forgive this man. he’s literally caused me so much pain. i doubt i would even be depressed if he was a normal parent. and those times where he yelled at me were painful asf. fuck. even now he has so much fucking power over me. thinking about those memories make me want to kms. he made me fucking hate myself. fuck me. so i felt really shitty exploring that memory and remembering the shit my dad has put me through. i don’t think i can ever forgive him for what he’s done. that made me feel really shitty. so i nappped and felt better. and did homework and felt productive. and played league. fuck the mere thought of him makes me so angry. speaking of that, he came home today and he already fucked with the chill ness on the house. he was arguing with my mom and just being a pest. fuck man genuinely enjoy living in the house with just my mom. fuck this guy. the worst part is he can continue living his life without consequence. he won’t ever understand or take responsibility for the pain he’s really caused me. guess fucking ignorance is bliss</div><div

woke up at 1. usually i wake up at 9 but today i decided to sleep lots. after i woke up i didn’t have much to do. but i started reading a manga called vagabond and i read two volumes. it’s honestly pretty good. the art is actually really fucking insane and i think the themes the series will explore will be interesting. lowkey i wanna start listening to audio books because i feel like that’s a much easier way to read without literally reading. idk tho. but after that i felt energized and listened to some music. been listening to a lot of new music lately. i also read al the lyrics for veteran and i understand the album a bit more. peggy lyricism and writing is actually crazy, there’s so many insane fucking bars. also jpeg is just such a relatable character to me. like he was depressed like me 😎. but on the real tho i have the same eccentric energy as him and like yelling and shit. also he talks a lot of shit and is pretty confrontational and i’m like that. and man spends a lot of time on the internet like me. was listening to production on veteran closely and that shit is so layered and genuinely so well crafted. people find his music weird as shit but it’s genuinely so good once you get used to weird fucking sounds. and really the absurdity of all the sounds just represents life on the internet, shits just so absurd nowadays (esp memes) that there’s no way better to describe it. anyways after that i had a snowball fight with amina kai ben and emma. and i dodnt have to organize so thank you guys for doing that. it was really fun but really tiring. but it’s always fun doing childish things with them. after that i went home and played league and now i’m lying in bed. the entire day was pretty good, i didn’t too much but i did a lot stuff that was fun. and the time alone i spent was nice, i never have the motivation to take a deeper look at an album but it’s so rewarding when i do it.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

whole morning and afternoon sleeping and chilling and listening to music and occasionally talking with friends. been listening to a lot of albums lately. got myself addicted to that music again. i listened to half of red house painters 1 and shits wayyyy too slow for me. but after all that i went to the centre and ate dinner and talked to people there. it was fucking nice and dandy. we celebrated tim’s birthday and drank a white claw. kinda dog shit tbh it’s just sparkling water. after that we want to sunalta park to play grounders for like two hours and shit was fun. playing is so fun but tiring but yeah. and running around is tiring asf too. but it’s fun. but time to flame amina kai emma and howard. i swear these mfs suck at fucking organizing. if i don’t actively take intiative in organizing shit is genuinely such a mess. it’s lowkey annoying that i always have to initiate and organize. but whatever the fun we had made up for it. and i don’t mind it that much just sometimes i’m just like bruh we would never hang out if i just stopped taking in the gc. anyways after that i drank my white claw and played league. it was fun. we’re in a 7 game winstreak in flex. kinda crazy. but yeah pretty tired. i’m not that excited for online but whatever. it’s crazy how far i’ve come. i’m at a point where i actually feel like i’m enjoying my life. and genuinely feel good about myself. like i don’t feel shitty if i nap or not do shit because i know that’s just me enjoying my time. and my perception on my entire worldview has changed so much in so little of time. but yeah it’s crazy man. and i never feel like i’m grinding my ass off. i feel good and happy that i’m just doing things slowly and chilling. like dropping ib has genuinely been one of the better decisions in my life. hell not giving a duck about school has been such a life changer for me. it’s genuinely so nice feeling like i’m enjoying everyday, it’s not hard to wake up or to just live. i didn’t know i didn’t have to work so hard to be happy. i used to think grinding will give me a sense of contentment and happiness but really it’s the opposite.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video

pretty good ngl. gotta listen to his older stuff more. i downloaded a lot of albums that aren’t a spotify, it’s surprising how much material people don’t put on spotify. sunny pisses me off so much with his presence now. it’s kinda bad. but idk i just find him annoying ever since i’ve started hating on him. it’s fucking annoying. there’s some tension and shiftiness with grace and i don’t like it. whatever it’s just annoying tbh. hopefully we go back in person but idk it’s whatever is the most responsible. i’m tired as shit i played a lot of league. also i love my dog so much. he’s fucking

honestly they roast themselves with their actions. but today will be a focused post on me. so i had my therapy appointment this morning and i finally cleared one of my traumatic memories!!! so i’m like a 1/3 done. i have two more memories to go and usually the next two are faster. i have to do my most recent traumatic memory and my worst traumatic. lowkey i don’t want to end so soon because it’s nice seeing a therapist. but i started naming all my traumatic memories just so we could figure out which one was the worst. and it was a long list. and shit bro like 85% of the traumatic memories involved my dad. like i remember at one point my mom started counting how many times we would argue in order to try and make us stop. and we would still argue all the time. like over half were about badminton too. it makes sense why i would grief every tournament too. i subconsciously associated losing with trauma and my dad yelling at me so i played worse. feels bad man. but yeah my dad really popped off by literally giving me a lot of trauma. i hate saying trauma, i feel so cringe saying it and like i feel like i’m over exaggerating and telling it worse then what really happened. but my therapist says it’s trauma and i trust what she says more then i trust myself. also cause i kinda know she’s right but i just don’t want to be pitied and like to ignore how much pain i’m really going through. also every time we argued i genuinely thought about suicide a lot and a lot of times i thought about taking my own life to spite my dad and show him how much of a piece of shit he is. so ig it’s trauma. and there’s more i’m just remembering now that i didn’t tell her about. i think the most recent one is when i first was depressed like september and he called me needy cause i was depressed and we strayed arguing and this guy like ran up to me (and he slipped on the floor too LOL) and he pushed me and i was ready to throw hands but my mom broke it up and started crying on the floor. i think one time he actually slapped me but i can’t really remember. oh yeah and one time when i was really depressed he</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

much to write about for my spam posts lowkey. school is closing next week and i’m pretty indifferent. i want to talk to people and lowkey not fall behind but also i wanna watch anime. plus i’ve been expecting school to shut down. playing league was fun. school is honestly enjoyable, english is a nice class even tho i’m on my phone a lot, physics was good and i think i did good on the test. art is okay but it’s whatever. i haven’t communicated with grace for like 3 days and i feel a lot better tbh. i’m like torvald being near a morally corrupt individual makes me sick to my stomach. jk idk why she made me feel so shitty but i genuinely feel so much better without her. also now i’m going to ego and be like these bitches always run back. being right feels so good because ego and idk it’s a nice fuck you to her. ever since i got pissed at sunny for egoing this guy has been just irking me more and just pissing me off more. lowkey uncomfortable with him now. and i keep on noticing his ego and it actually pisses me off. but i did my part in spreading awareness of sunny being a piece of shit and learned more about the actions he’s done. lowkey girls are not confrontational at all. the only girls that are is annika and her friend group but like we need more woman to stand up for themselves and tell this guy to fuck off. tbh even tho the writing was cringe by annika, i respect her for actually standing up for her friend and confronting him. but homie is still repeating his behaviour. i wonder how many peoples he’s asked out</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

has only come because weilan implied on her spam that she was a narcissist and it fucking irked me. like why is it now a flex to be manipulative or narcissistic on social media now. like nobody’s fucking scared bro esp if you outright say it. and generally i’ve seen some of her spam posts where she makes depression and mental health quirky and it’s genuinely so annoying. like bruh this shit ain’t a personality trait. her i want attention syndrome was going off tho. but also i swear this girl is a snake. like the fact that she and sunny got closer together even tho she knows that sunny fucking played bianca so hard (and her and bianca were tight asf lowkey) is honestly disrespect. i genuinely don’t know how sunny has so many girl friends. like i swear this guy has no fucking moral compass when it comes to girls. like he’s so desperate he will do anything to get a girls attention. and i’ve heard this guy talk so MUCH shit about weilan and now they’re suddenly friends like what? the fact that sunny dated bianca while liking her bsf is just so much disrespect. and playing bianca so hard like genuinely i feel so bad for bianca. oh yeah and weilan was like THE friend for bianca during their breakup, i saw bianca cry so much and weilan being there to like help her. and now weilan is friends with sunny 😐😐😐. okay i pray to you guys that nobody snitch on me because i’m not supposed to say this, but also grace told me this when we reconciled and idc about her snymore. but sunny told jenna that she liked her within a week of knowing each other. like how desperate are you? how do you even develop feelings so fast? and like it’s not like they talked a lot either, they just had surface level small talk and shit. but to be fair i asked out angel in like a week but still, that was a mistake but we did really like each other. and like he made jenna guess his crush it’s so cringe. oh yeah and sunny was cuddling with judy in the cafeteria like a week after he and bianca broke up. idk why i’m talking so much shit but lowkey he’s been triggering me recently and i his moral code and desperation</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

bruh idek how i sleep so much. i was really energetic but then all of a sudden i’m super drained and i sleep for so long. anyways my therapist says i’m growing a lot so that’s something to be proud of. i realized i’m really shitty at not having a clear answer and pressure myself to have one. for example i want to know what to do with grace and be very clear and overt about it but tbh i should just stop reaching out so much and just see. i should just shy away from the negative and towards the positive. i don’t need to know anything, i just do what my feelings tell me to do. also i try to make logic out of my feelings and it sucks. and human situations i try to choose logic when all of is just an emotional thing yk? but apparently before i used to solve things only with logic and not my emotions. but now i’m learning to accept my emotions and respect them. but i’m still working on having to know an answer immediately about my emotions. like i rather like someone completely or hate someone rather be unsure. but i gotta live with that uncertainty. i’ve been improving a lot ever since i first went to therapy and it’s crazy to think about. it’s hard to remember how i was. like this week i had is considered a low week and in comparison it’s not that bad. but with grace i don’t think i’m gonna reach out, i gain nothing from it and it’s kinda brain dead because she never reaches out to me. plus it’s easier to enjoy my life not thinking about the stress of our relationship. it’s always been stressful being friends with her but i think i don’t mind letting go. but who knows i’ll see for a bit how things go and maybe things will change. but i gotta trust how i feel. i was empathizing with her and explaining why she wasn’t reaching out but at the end of the day she isn’t and there’s nothing i can do about that. she’s not really meeting my needs as a friend so it’s unfair to myself to be offering myself as a friend when she doesn’t do the same.</div><div class="_3-95

sometimes but he can ego so hard and it’s genuinely so annoying. it doesn’t really matter too much but it pisses me off. lowkey i don’t want to be friends with grace. talking to her just makes me feel like shit for no reason. and idk we’re not even connecting like how we used to. and we don’t have anything to talk about. like i feel like we’re trying to refuel a dead friendship and it’s not going to work. there’s no embers left. i’ll ask my therapist but yeah things aren’t the same anymore and that’s just the truth. i’m lowkey addicted to geometry dash now, played that in all my classes. my sister is leaving tomorrow which is sad. i volunteered with amina today and it was honestly pretty fun. it’s fun spending time with her tbh. i went home and napped and grinder my visual representation. i’m kinda sketched about it but hopefully i do good m. played a game of league after to chill. i genuinely felt better with her out of my life and idk it also feels like she’s not opening up really. it’s dumb because it’s the same thing again really. i have to initiate everything even tho i’m not really the one that wants to be friends with her or the one that fucked up and got us into this situation. i guess things never change; i’m taking initiative yet again when she was the one that begged for me back. it’s frustrating tbh. and i’m not trying to roast a particular person but when people were happy i reconciled with her, saying she was a good friend it’s not really true. to be completely honest sometimes she was good but a lot of times she was bad. esp the last time she was horrible. and i’m not going to forgot about it because i need to set a boundary and she needs to face the consequences of her actions. because tbh i wasn’t really happy we reconciled. i was willing to try but i wasn’t happy. because honestly she was a bad friend. she might’ve been really close but she definitely was a bad friend. and that’s the truth, she caused a lot of pain. and maybe it’s for the better that i’m not friends with her. because she doesn’t make me feel better about myself at all. and it feels like</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

pretty good. i feel pretty bad for not trying to be closer to some people. lowkey i’m feeling like an outsider. because i’ve changed so much over the last couple of months. i kinda felt like shit for a bit but i got through it. idk what to talk to grace about it anymore, i’m a little sad that we’re not returning to what once we’re. so ig my day was bad because i felt like kinda shit. but overall it wasn’t horrible. bruh sometimes i find it crazy that people find enjoyment in reading my rants. like it’s kinda shocking that you guys read these. this visual representation is kinda hard and shouldn’t have procrastinated it but it is what it is. hopefully i’ll get it done on time. i really love totoro, he genuinely makes me so happy. i have so much love for him. like genuinely other then angel i haven’t loved someone so much. like damn he makes me so fucking happy bro. and he’s so adorable and ugh man i love him so much. i just want him to be happy. i napped a lot today because i stayed up yesterday. staying up is not worth it. even tho things could be better, i’m not feeling too horrible. lowkey if me and grace aren’t going to return to how we were, i might just be like surface level friends with her because she’s kind of a reminder of what i used to have with her. and i just don’t need that reminder in my life. because it’s not my fault that it ended, it’s hers. but i still feel like shit because of her actions. we will see tho. i wish i had someone close but the feelings of loneliness are less intense. so i’m doing a lot better with all of this</div><div

_a6-i">okay i watched end of evangalion and it’s really good. i think this one was better executed then the other ending, the director really outdid himself again. shits confusing asf tho, it’s like listening to an album. i did a little bit of reading so i have a better understanding. i prefer the original ending ngl, people say EoE is better but tbh i like the og ending because i think it breaks the 4th wall in a really clever way. i might be capping my ass off but i think that it becomes apparent that the instrumentality project was to show the audience of the show the themes of the show and teach them a lesson. shinji is the means to our end. we explore the entire journey with him in order to learn from him. but idk i need to watch the show lowkey again to get a better understanding. i can see why mad mfs hate this show tho. it rejects so many common anime tropes which makes it realistic but boring and not enjoyable. the imagery is crazy too. the show is way too confusing. idk it’s fire. i really need to open my heart up. and honestly this show kinda reminds me of grace. i was willing to fight for a painful relationship because i my heart was open. she closed off hers and ran away from me. she didn’t take accountability because she needed to protect herself and her ego. i don’t want to sound like a piece of shit but at the end of the day maybe she needed me more then i needed her. she just never opened up. she was scared i’d hurt her. i did hurt her but she bottled it up. what’s the limit then? is abuse the limit? how much can someone take before it’s unhealthy? i don’t know really. maybe it’s just an accountability thing. fuck up a lot and you need to wait a long time before you can talk again. wait for forgiveness. yeah that would make sense. grace doesn’t forgive me and i’m okay with that. she doesn’t need to. i can’t force her to either. i will be better then i was tho. i’ll try my best to make sure i won’t hurt her like i did with others. i’m going to open up to people. even tho i fucking hate who i am, i won’t hold my self hatred against the world. one day i’ll love who i am. for now saying those words make me cringe and feel fucking uncomfortable as shit.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202104/168084033_558491181769629_1998474828919971366_n_17862318626444652.jpg"><img

just finished neon genesis evangelism and that shit was hella confusing but fire asf. like there was a series of episodes that were lowkey boring but it’s honestly really well made. the ending is mad confusing tho. i still don’t know what’s going on ngl. but it’s fucking amazing tbh. it takes so many cinematic risks like still images and just weird shit but i think it’s fire asf that they did it. i think the way they built most of the characters is really well. like the development of shinji is definitely solid, he evolves a lot during the show but definitely seems a reasonable evolution. the incorporation of everyone’s trauma is pretty insane and it does a good representation on how it affects people later in life and what it does to people. bruh the ending is so confusing i’m still thinking about it. lowkey it’s like a poem tho, this might sound like i’m hyping this shit too much but i studied szymborska poems and i think her best poems are the most ambiguous because it is able to cover so many themes and topics about life with a couple of stanza. i feel the same way about this, it covers a huge aspect of life and the human condition in 26 episodes. i can see why people don’t like it tho. there aren’t many fight scenes, there are many scenes of them spewing scientific bullshit. plot is relatively slow and everything gets thrown on to its head at the end. like they put so many twists at the end. along with that it’s confusing asf, it starts adrultly and some episodes you just get thrown in. some characters are super unlikable. there’s so many like dreams that are basically acid trips which are confusing.  so definitely in the case to entertain an audience it’s definitely not the best. but i think the ending of it is just too good. it legit reminds me of a syzmborska poem. the ending is really what defines her poems and so was this. but i think looking at this anime in terms of an artistic standpoint it’s one of the best pieces of art i’ve ever consumed. the ability to encapsulate important themes of humanity is impressive. and most importantly, it really feels like shinji got to the conclusion of hoping in the future if not hating himself

do know but it’s brain dead and i hate it. fuck my life man. i always project things outwards and it’s so brain dead and i hate myself for it. i don’t always feel alone but sometimes i wish i had someone that was really close to me. fuck me man. i can’t believe spring break is almost over. it’s been while since i’ve had someone worthy of crying over. idk i just want to feel something or idek. i guess i just want something meaningful. what always sucks is that i always feel like i don’t have something meaningful. but maybe i’ll just continue indulging myself in random things to make things easier for me. i can’t help but feel like a failure and that i’ll never be loved. it almost seems like it’s for the better. i’ve lost a lot of faith in myself and in the world in general. well

triggered. and then ryan wei said some dumb shit, it didn’t hurt but i’m on high alert rn. but yeah fuck this i’m actually super fucking tilted rn. fuck i don’t want to give mfs power over me but i think i just need to accept that it lowkey kinda made me feel like shit. plus cody came into the call and made fun of my rings and at first i didn’t know who this mf was but now i’m like bruh i haven’t talked to this guy in forever and he’s out here being a piece of shit for no reason. what the fuck. i would be taking all of this fine but i was already tilted from league and felt like shit from my therapy session. fuck i should stop flaming ryan so much but this guy pisses me off so much. fuck man tonight was so shitty for no reason fuck. fuck cody and ryan i’m actually fucking mad. and fuck grace too. i didn’t think about her for 3 days but i can confidently say she’s a fucking delusional asshole. fuck i’m so angry rn. and i realized i lowkey wore a mask to hide his shitty i feel

a long ass time. so basically i did nothing for a day. but i walked my dog which was fun. he wanted to run so i ran with him. after that i picked up emma kai and amina and we went out to get boba. it was really windy so we ran to cocos. at cocos we played heads up and it was pretty fun being overly loud and stuff. after we got kicked cause it was closed it was snowing and it was really pretty so we took some photos. we didn’t spend long and i’m surprised they turned out so well. i’m standing like a bad bitch. then we ran back to car and amina emma and kai started throwing snowballs elat each other. so we got to my house and had a huge snowball fight. it was really fun i was super tired from running around. id also say i won. we sent emma home (after a few surprise snowballs at the end) then kai then amina. overall hanging out with them was super fun. it was really pretty snowing outside. i’m tired from having so much fun. honestly i enjoy driving people around. like sometimes it can be exhausting but sometimes it’s enjoyable to do. when everyone is having fun. it’s like i’m a dad and all my kids are happy. cause i’m not really involved in the fun cause i gotta focus on the road but i seep the energy. i had dj today and my legs are tired from running. i’m really unfit but whatever. i hope i can have more days like this :))))</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a

idk. but it was pretty fun. after that i went home napped and did hw and played league. i didn’t feel as good today but whatever. i still enjoyed myself today. and had a good time. westmount homies i

_a6-i">i played league for the first time in forever. still a brain dead game but fun to talk to friends over. i’ve been feeling really good these past couple of days, i’ve been socializing like crazy. like lowkey i became friends with emily (i can’t tel if she finds me annoying because i feel like i’m being annoying) and have just been talking to tom and other grade 12s. grace has been holding back my full potential. i’m only saying this because there’s probably no coorelarion but fuck her. but yeah i’ve been talking to mad people. i napped i physics cause i was so hyped for the entire day talking to mfs. it’s crazy how social i am now that i’m not super fucking sad all day. also it’s nice to be winning because i KNOW grace is malding. fuck her. it’s fun asf just shitting on her tbh. i talked to the people i used to play league with and it’s nice. leo’s chilling and varun. playing with tia is nice too, i remember when we all used to grind league it was fun asf. fuck ryan tho. i can’t tell if i’m annoying asf or like somebody that’s enjoyable to talk to. because lowkey i just insert myself into conversations with random people. but also high key the easiest way to be friendly is to act dumb as shit. i swear all my humour is me just acting dumb asf. bro i actually feel light. shit a lot of the heaviness is gone. i just have a lot more confidence in going up to people and just talking with them. and more energy to do so. i lowkey became friends with johnathan too because we have physics together and he’s really impressive and nice. that’s why school feels so enjoyable nowadays, talking to people is actually what keeps me going.  because i hate grace i’m blaming all this sudden lightness in me cutting her off. tom is also the homie i remember why i love this guy so much. i seriously feel like a new me rn. just the way i’ve been talking to people and shit. and having positive emotions. this all feels so new and good tbh. today was a good day. now i just need to catch feelings for someone. jk i’m pretty happy rn. but who knows tomorrow i might cry and want to die but atleast today i felt good. and new</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

break which fucking sucks. i feel like my prt i wrote today was worst then the last one and i def bombed my physics unit test. i skipped art today to hang out with tom and his friends. it’s been a long time and they’re honestly funny asf and i’m gonna miss them next year. i had alumni and it was pretty fucking good. also ryan wei js a dumbass because he early applied to nyu and got in. so now he has to pay like a 100k a year in expenses because the US is so expensive. and nyu stem programs aren’t even good LOL. he’s legit grieving rn. i bet tom $10 he’s gonna get expelled LOL. i went home

about how i don’t trust myself. which i really don’t i try to analyze every emotion i have. it’s pretty bad. also emma accidentally told eric i see a therapist and this mf looked so shook. it was kinda funny. my therapist was like it’s a strength that you’re so open and you’re not afraid to be yourself but the drawback to that is that you are more emotional. which makes sense tbh. i’m really scared i fuck things up but i can’t be controlled by my fears. i’m feeling pretty bad rn. feelings of emptiness and unworthiness is coming up. i realized that i’ve never felt emotionally safe with anyone, really it’s only been with angel and maybe grace, it’s hard to say for her because she was never really reliable. it’s kinda sad tho. and sometimes i’ll fight off that closeness because of defends mechanisms. but i really want to try to feel emotionally safe with someone. it’s a nice feeling. i think that’s what im&#064;missing in my life. it won’t solve all my problems but it’ll make

takes up so much energy that it makes me tired for 5 days. i took like a 3 hour nap today so i lowkey got like 12 hours of sleep. i feel like shit now, feel directionless and meaningless and i’m really questioning my feelings because i don’t trust myself at all. i really need to trust myself bruh. i might actually just get a caffeine addiction just because of how tired i am. it’s so bad and it’s genuinely untreatable. i’m literally on my bed 24 hours a day cause i’m tired or depressed. walking my dog makes me so depressed because my mind somehow always wanders to bruh my dog is the only thing that loves me and that’s because he’s dumb. i love him tho he makes me happy. honestly i remember why i held grace so close and fought so hard even tho she sucked. she would ask how my day was and text me, which is nice to have that interaction, and would atleast pretend to care about me. she wasn’t reliable and chose her ego over me and lied to me but it was nice knowing that someone cares. the little things mean a lot to me. but it was also special because it came from somebody that was close to me. idk man i don’t miss it too much. in general i think i’ve emotionally just accepted what has happened. i’m not the angry nor sad i’m just remembering what made me feel better. i’m sad and depressed because i feel alone and stressed because i procrastinate, helpless because of my sleep and mental state, paranoid because i can’t trust myself, directionless asf and overall i feel shitty about myself because i feel shitty. i know i shouldn’t but there’s so much i have to change about myself and i don’t want to do it. i want to cry but i have no tears. fuck man the only contentment i ever reach in my life now is catharsis. other then that i’m never content. that’s so sad. the only time i’m like yeah i feel pretty good for a long amount of time is after experiencing a bunch of shitty feelings. fuck. fick and i just realized i’m being a piece of shit rn. bruh i’m so

going to continue hating on her because fuck her and her friends and everything she stands for. and i kinda realized that i don’t even need her in my life. like she was never reliable so lowkey she caused more stress then support for me. so i ain’t even mad she’s out of my life. the one thing that sucks is that i don’t have anyone to go theifitjng with anymore LOL. whatever. i had fun today, i

pretty fun. i’m tired asf now. spent the whole day out. thinking about grace makes me so unbelievably angry, which is nice, hating on mfs just cause is fun. she makes me very mad when i see her. and she’s such a fucking pussy, she’s too scared to ever confront me in person. school was tiring asf. i think i popped off on my unit test for physics which is nice. skating is fun asf tbh. and it’s hype because i’m just screaming lyrics in my suburban neighborhood. it’s hype. i had fun by myself today and that hasn’t happened in a very long time. i’m considering going back and playing badminton once just for shits. now fhG i mentioned grace ima be lowkey mad for a while. but it’s good that i’m mad, it means i’m confident that i’m in the right. and as long as i don’t do any dumb shit i’ll continue being in the right. because genuinely i’ve done all i can and she’s being a piece of shit because she needs to protect her fragile ego and her fear of standing up for herself.</div><div class="_3-95

like anything i do i’m so tired. i walk my dog and i come home and i’m exhausted. like i fr feel like i’m running at 10% of my capacity. it’s so hard to do anything too when i’m so tired. i can’t do home work and i’m too lazy to take care of my plants. it’s so fucking depressing. i feel really fucking empty and alone rn. it’s pretty bad. i think i’m starting to take what grace said personally because i have an innate belief that im a piece of shit. not really tho idk. i really don’t want to give her that power over me. but at this point my emotions control me. i try my best to stop them but it’s so hard. i seem to make every activity that’s supposed to help with being depressed worse. like if i workout i’m just like what am i pushing so hard for, this is just like my life. if i go for a walk i think about things a lot and at the end i’m like you’re so alone carsyn. i’m so fucking pessimistic now it’s bad. sometimes my dog will be excited to see me and i’m like you’re so alone that the only thing that loves you is a dog. too dumb to know the real you. i feel like nobody will love me for the real me. grace didn’t. angel didn’t. i can’t believe this shit. maybe i’m just the bad person here. fuck. i’m sick of feeling lonely. i’m sick of being tired all the time. i’m sick of being me. i don’t think anybody will love the real me. isn’t that lonely? it’s almost a year since i broke up with angel. that means it’s almost a year i’ve been depressed. 9 months. three more months. 5 months since i attempted. does it get better? maybe i’ll never be satisfied. i just need a mentally ill gf bro. my one wish</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202103/160541484_126352392762176_7462288202558065661_n_18071194402268369.jpg"><img

but really i think it’s because it’s not really the happy ending. but it’s realistic. i think the best part about the show is the realism. it depicts change and depression in an accurate portrayal. bojack does good and changes but after does bad. i think it doesn’t cut any corners for its realism. and a lot of it i didn’t like, i wish they’re were decisions that changed the story so the storytelling and show can be more enjoyable but i realize that would sacrifice the accuracy and authenticity the show has. it doesn’t sugar coat life in anyway and that’s something i respect. and to make sure it’s not too intense there’s wacky and witty writing which serves as a break to the emotionally potent part of the shows and i would watch the show just for the jokes. i enjoyed the social commentary on the show too. the characters are really well written to, bojack is the best because even tho he’s changed for the better, you every episode you can’t really tell he did (almost like real change) diane is good, she doesn’t have her shit figured out but you can see that she’s trying so hard and it feels like me, princess caroline is good too, she feels like what i used to be, working my ass off to fill the void and todd is great because he keeps it casual but at the end learns to be a contributing member of society. but the great thing about all these characters is that there change comes slowly. it feels gradual and real unlike other shows or books. because unlike what my prt i write about says, just because of one experience doesn’t mean i’m completely changed. and all these characters learn at the end is that they can trust the happiness. well some more then others but theyre learning too. and even though i’ve been hurt so much and want to be safe and invulnerable, i have to trust. well i have to try to atleast. it’s a good show i’d recommended you watch. the characters genuinely do feel so real</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

write this down. WHY TF AM I THE ONLY GUY WHO NATURALLY SITS CROSS LEGGED WHEN IM ON A PLASTIC CHAIR. i mean i know why because it lowkey crushes our balls BUT WHY IS IT MY FIRST SITTING POSITION. like why did i make this a random ha it i do. no guy sits cross legged except me and like bruh how did i end up like this. i feel like i look dumb as shit sitting cross legged. but it’s just so comfortable bro. i can rest my arm on my legs and idk man it just feels nice. and it’s not the cross legged where you make a square with your calves and thighs it’s the ball crushing one (why do i associate it femininity probably because of the ball crushing.) i think maybe it’s cause i remember watching that buzzfeed video on man spreading when i was like in grade 5 and was like i don’t want to be misogynistic piece of shit so then i started crossing my legs and now it’s a habit. but now i’m just a dumbass because i crush my balls on habit. okay it’s not that bad i’ve gotten used to it (i wonder if my body has evolved to adapt?) also on chairs with cushion i put one leg under. i actually know why because at the dinner table i couldn’t reach the food cause i was short asf so i put a foot under my ass so i was taller and could reach for food. and now it’s a habit. but it’s also uncomfortable asf because i always shift my feet and it’s always my right leg that’s under and it’s super dumb. why can’t i sit like a normal person. but sitting normally just feels so uncomfortable. plus i like feeling taller then i am when i’m sitting on cushioned chairs. why am i so observant on these dumb things. and why do i have a rationale for them too. anyways i’m fucking dumb. but seriously have you ever seen a guy cross there legs and sit. like i’ve never really paid attention but i don’t think i have. anyways season 5 of bojack horseman is so good i think i’m binging the entire series in under a week. also what’s the point of a day off tomorrow if i can’t leave the house and go to school. it’s like a

_a6-i">my fake golf that i bought a month ago came in. it’s super cute and my mom and dad were complimenting it. i’m starting to feel alone and empty again. it’s been a long time since i got irl human interaction and without that my life feels pretty empty. there’s a comfort in my emptiness tho. there’s a lot of times where i was like why don’t i feel more sad about grace. a lot of thoughts like shouldn’t i feel like nobody will love the real me. i guess that’s what 7 months of hard depression does to a mf. not thinking negative thoughts feels unnatural and unauthentic. and this isn’t me encouraging negative thoughts it’s just i’ve felt empty for so long it’s weird not having that feeling during my few highs. i think one of the things keeping me afloat is that i think i’m a good person. i think i did all i could with grace. i think i do the right thing. i’m not really sure tho. one of my biggest fear is becoming ignorant or narcissistic. i beat myself pretty heavy to become the good person i want to be. that’s a common theme in my life, the most damage someone does to me is myself. i wonder when this is all over. when everyday i feel a bit of contentment or stability. the only way i can hope for stability is for someone to love me unconditionally because i can’t for myself. i never really got the concept of unconditional love. isn’t all love conditional? we decide our boundaries with people and whether we want to love them. maybe i’m just holding on some bullshit concept that humans made to make them feel less alone. but still i want that. a shoulder i can cry on. someone who always has time to listen and talk to me. i’m ready to do that for them. but hey i honestly only think i’m ready because i’m depressed asf and will do snything to fill the loneliness. and then when i get better i’ll be a piece of shit and ditch them because i don’t need them anymore. i miss ranting drunk. all the thoughts just flow. anyways i’m kinda tired. i feel like i have a lot to say but idk what to say. i always have a lot on my mind</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

to start thinking but this way but i can’t help but think about it. but whatever i’m in a pretty good mood a lot, albeit kinda bored. today i thought i’m enjoying this moment rn and was appreciating the sunset and that hasn’t happened in a month. so that’s definitely nice. i wanna have an ongoing conversation with someone but idk who. i also want a gf but that’s not happening. they can prove they

did all i could and that most of the blame is on her ngl. but now i feel kinda lonely cause i realized we won’t do anything together but not that bad tbh. because honestly i’ll find someone better then her, it’s not hard because i just need someone who thinks they actually have obligations as a friend. thinking about it still i don’t really get it. like the only way i can really think of is i starting becoming too much for her and asking too much from her (which is kinda valid) but doesn’t know how to confront me (which is dumb asf because i’ve told her she can tell me anything and her communicating is key to us prospering) and then her feeling spiraled out of control and then she went through hella mental gymnastics (like saying she has no obligation to me) to make her not feel shitty about herself. because i’m still genuinely shocked that someone can really just admit no fault in the situation. like i fucked up a lot, i did overstep my boundaries a lot (making jokes i shouldn’t have, saying ily too much, maybe excessively affectionate) but also it’s hard to put a lot responsibility on me when she never communicated her discomfort. along with that every time she did feel uncomfortable instead of communicating she would ghost me for a couple of days and i had to pry out of her what was wrong. but that was really exhausting for me too, i hated that because i was willing to be confronted by what i did wrong and it made extremely insecure and scared that she hated me. and she never really ever acknowledged my emotions or validated them. but id always let it go because i believed she was a good person and i loved her (platonically ofc). plus i thought she just showed it in a different way, she gave me a lot a letters about supporting me and caring about me and loving me along with a lot of gifts too. so we also exchanged gifts a lot. which is confusing, she said my excessive saying i love you felt like something more then friends but we would do all these things that were</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202103/158433891_163728922140783_4178090602934441680_n_18000582724309666.jpg"><img

all gone. i bawled my eyes out at the therapist so that was nice. just talked about grace and how basically everything is really on her terms rn and i feel way more shit then she does because she’s in control. cried like a bitch. then i went home cause no way i’m still going to school when i just cried like a mf. but it was a good cry i felt good after. then i went home and my dad (a fucking genius) told me to not be sad anymore. and to forgot about bad things. and to not let my emotions control me. and then i told him how fucking stupid he is for saying that because i just can’t forgot about being sad or just be happy or just get over it. so we had this brain dead argument thag made me realize that this mf is dumbest man on earth. i told him that how stupid just be happy is. and he wouldn’t believe me. like bruh i was being sarcastic as shit telling him that he solved depression by saying just be happy and i kid you not this guy smiled and was like you finally get it. LIKE BRO? ARE YOU STUPID? like holy shit these mfs are so dense in the mf brains bro. and then he yelled at me for letting my emotions control me. and then i pointed out that he’s being ironic asf because he’s angry that i let my emotions control me. sick of dumbasses. nobody is meeting my needs rn and it’s dumb asf. i feel like im too fucking needy bro. fuck this. i don’t understand how i try so hard and still sad. it feels like i do everything i can and i’m still empty as shit and nobody understands me. honestly the shit that pisses me off the most is mfs who don’t accept the truth and don’t take accountability. like bruh you really gonna live in ignorance so your ego won’t get hurt huh? aww you poor baby your ego must hurt so much. is it really that hard to be like yeah i fucked up. fuck these people maybe i’m just fucking dumb huh? i’m the common denominator. whatever man i try so hard and can’t be happy. i trust my therapist and she says i’m doing everything i can. and im not getting rewarded. bullshit ass life. fuck this shit. god can smd for making such a dog shit world.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

out with howard ben and emma for a decent amount of time too. it was pretty fun. i didn’t have a breakdown today which was nice. i’ve had a lot of realizations lately and it’s kinda depressing but whatever. i’m so done with a lot of peoples shit rn ngl. i don’t feel like getting really emotionally invested into any friendship anymore, maybe howard but that’s about it. i don’t want to sound

cry once today. yesterday i sobbed my fucking eyes out in front of my family. just sobbing and breaking down. and now today i’m still feeling the affects of that. suicidal thoughts are more intense and prominent. i can’t do this shit for much longer. my entire morality is being questioned by myself. i feel so fucking alone. i’ve never felt this lonely in my life. that’s deadass. but honestly i’m sick of this relationship shit. at this point being alone and in my room all day is easier then going outside. i just feel like isolating myself at this point. i’m fucking losing it honestly. i can’t take this anymore. my brain seems so fucked with emotions that i can’t even think logically about things anymore. how did i end up here? i’m paranoid now too, there’s always a thought that someone is manipulating and using me. fuck i’ll never be happy. fuck god. fuck the universe. most of all fuck me. i’m just gonna become a fucking degenerate at this point. i don’t even want to go to school anymore, my social anxiety just randomly developed out of no where. i feel so fucking dumb now, i can’t even speak to anybody. i spent the majority of the school day in the fucking stalls wanting to cry. fuck it, might push everyone away as a defensive mechanism and never get better. see the thing is i’m self aware but too depressed to do anything about it. i feel like nobody fucking understands me and my fucking pain. nobody fucking understands the shit i go through. and it’s so fucking frustrating. idk. time to numb the pain and the hatred with youtube. i said fuck a lot. the only thing that motivates me to life is the hope that i can get a mentally ill music nerd goth gf. jk i’m just scared to die</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

i’ve had horrible breakdowns today and rn, i doubt i’m going to school. unfortunately i gave into my desires and i’m drinking again. im not cutting or burning but i’m lowkey self harming when i’m breaking down this bad. i choke myself (ik i’m kinky😏😏😏) or just slap myself really hard. is this even considered self harm? something about the adrenaline makes me feel better. but now i’m drunk and the pain has gone numb. today was one of the worst breakdowns i’ve ever had. i’m always so dramatic about the tiniest things and i try to let my logic but my irrational emotions always win over. i’m also dog shit at school now. i can’t believe i’m actually considering dropping out. i feel like i’m falling apart. i hope i don’t upset anyone with this rant. i am falling apart. im just trying to be as honest as i can be rn. i need to let out all these thoughts. i don’t know how long i can live like this. when i’m super depressed and thinking  life i think i rather die. also contrasting the contentment and bliss i felt as a child and my current depressing and painful life makes me jealous and realizes life isn’t really worth living. but i won’t do anything about it, i’m too scared anyways. all i can do is drown the pain with this bottle of alcohol and live life (or lack of living) like i’m a slave to the pain. i feel like i’m becoming distant to everyone because i’m just a failure or something. or just changing way too. much. i’m so different now. i feel so weak no trauma has really happened to me and i’ve gotten so depressed. i feel like i’m going to get sent to a psych ward again. i also feel like i’m way too depressed and there’s no saving me. i feel like a failure. i used to be so good at school and life. but now i’m just a depressed worthless piece of shit. i had everything. and now i have nothing. i feel like i’ve done all i can do and if i died rn i wouldn’t mind. but i don’t have means or intent so please don’t send me to the psych ward. i’m just gonna get drunk today. and i’m letting out all the thoughts that’s been on my mind</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

today. and making so many rings but don’t have a girl to give it too 😔😔. should i start an etsy or ig just to make some cash?</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

listening to this lecture thing that’s like 36 hours so i can understand classical more. but i feel like i’m just wasting my time but whatever. it was cool but now it’s boring asf because it’s

kinda shit but we’re improving. i took my first pill of acutane and my skin is already lowkey dry. i’m not hype at all for school but whatever. i had a lot of breakdowns but overall had a lot of fun this weekend. hanging out with friends was fun, talking to richard was exciting tbh and listening to records is fun. but i’ve been also feeling really off all the time lately, i can’t really stand it. i’ve started crying a lot more too. i hate my life rn honestly. i can’t stand having all these emotions and taking all this medicine to make me be normal. it feels so hard for me to be happy. also

with my parents but it was cold asf so it kinda sucked. but i made dumplings and it was fun. they’re learning to talk to me i think. i’m not really sure. i’ve been really insecure these last couple of days too. it feels like the only thing that makes me happy is music. and clothes. retail therapy is pretty nice too. also staying up till 10 is genuinely a struggle, i’m so tired rn. i think i’m really desperate for a relationship rn, tbh idk a point of my life where i’m not desperate for a relationship. it’s kinda sad tbh. i know the relationship won’t do me any good but i still try so hard. i guess the idea of one just seems so fun. suddenly i’m scared asf for english. i’m just tired. i’ve been thinking about a lot of destructive behaviour, i’m scared ill stop caring about my life. actually i’m not scared really. but a big part of me doesn’t want to give in but a big part doesn’t care about my life anymore and wants to throw it away ig. honestly i don’t understand how i was a

corduroy pants and a jacket. i got prescribed acutane. i need so many drugs to fix myself. i’m crying rn because i feel super insecure about everything. if some people got up and left my life i genuinely don’t know what i would do. i woke up and looked at something very irrelevant and got triggered. idk what to do. i am always so empty. everything just seems like a distraction to the fact that i hate myself, insanely insecure about losing people and feel unworthy of even having friends. i mean i just rant about the same things over and over again. i’m in such desperation for romance. because even tho i’m probably wrong, it’s made me feel so alive. so so alive. but i guess that passion fades away after awhile. i just think about the people i love rn. it’s the only way i get by. i hate being so reliant, i’ve never been so reliant in my life. i don’t trust people because i had to do all the fixing. but it’s the only way i can live rn. so i’m trying my best to live for all of you guys. it’s hard asf. there’s been a lot of times where i wanted to numb the pain with drugs or self harm but i haven’t. i swear i’m trying my best. i don’t want to disappoint you guys. i’ve already

_a6-i">letting a meme page help me through a depressive episode 😃😃😃. anyways yesterday i had a pretty bad depressive episode. i’m still kinda feeling it this morning but not as much. when they happen i feel really agitated and just sad. it’s like when you’re trying to sleep but you can’t and you keep rolling around in bed but you’re also depressed about life. i find myself overreacting to things i shouldn’t really be. and i feel like it’s really bad too, i feel like my emotions cause me to be toxic. so idk what to do with them. do i say them out loud and risk being controlling? do i keep it inside and let it destroy me? even though i’m open to say all this shit on my spam, there’s only one person where i talk about my emotions and feelings to. it feels really absurd how someone like me can exist. the amount of hatred i have for myself is crazy. back when i was competitive over badminton i would use self destructive behaviour all the time. i would make my losses hurt so much that i would motivate myself to be better. i was so uncontrollably angry at myself all the time. i got myself, swore at myself and make myself cry. the amount of times i thought about suicide is absurd, over some sport. it’s sad to see honestly. all i cared about was winning. all my life i’ve just been hating on who i am, never thinking i’m enough. and that’s why i always say i just want to be happy. i don’t give a shit about success or winning or money. you get all of that and you sit with it for a while and then you’re like i want more now. it’s an addiction. once you take a hit of success you just crave for more hits. you’ll go through hell getting those hits, you look at the mirror realizing you’re an addict to the system but you can’t stop. an addict has withdrawals but these drugs have seeped so far into you that you don’t know any other way of living. maybe i’m just speaking out of my ass. pretending to be woke but really just hating on the world because i failed myself. maybe i’m so jcole headass. i just want to be happy. everyone promises i’ll be happy in the future if i follow these steps, society tells me to go to uni and get a job and a family, my therapist says pay me $200 a session</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202102/148468500_2850290508526176_5645301205410018365_n_17872743683186805.jpg"><img

things we talk about but she can still teach me how to love myself. and maybe i’ve been asking too much from her, trying to make her answer questions about life that ultimately i only can answer. i explored how much i hated myself today with her, it’s crazy how much i do. just so much hatred. i don’t really trust love and trust people, always feeling unworthy. my therapist asked me what i would tell to my 5 year old self and i just said i pitied him. because i hated him. but i’m learning unconditional love. theres people trying to teach me what it means, esp one person in particular, and i’m glad they are. it’s hard opening up to love, esp when i feel unworthy of it. sometimes it catches me off guard when someone really loves me even if it’s not in their interest to. but a lot of people have done that and slowly opening me up and making me believe i’m worthy of love. because at the end of the day, if i don’t love myself, the feelings of emptiness and loneliness will continue to persist. i’m really learning a lot about life rn. i still find it crazy how much i hate myself. i don’t even like the pure and innocent version of me. but i’m trying and i hope i learn.</div><div

took try hard hand pics 😁😁😁😁😁. anyways i havent really been on the spam because someone helped me realize that the way i’ve been using my spam has been an unhealthy coping mechanism. in general, i’ve been doing a lot of things that’s been really unhealthy for coping. i’m glad they told me; i would’ve just gone deeper into the hole if they never told me. i feel a lot better now and i feel good today. i just made these two rings, i’m really proud of the first one, i tried something new and it worked out really well. i was bit on a hiatus on jewelry making but i think it’s something i genuinely enjoy. i feel like with a lot of my hobbies i try really hard to be good at them and it really saps the joy out of my hobbies. i think my therapist is lowkey full of shit now. her philosophy of life, living for your “true self” and doing things that “you truly find interesting” or doing thjngs for your “soul” seems like full of shit. i’ve subscribed to her way of life for a couple months and even though i do feel happier, i still feel meaningless and empty. so i just started going off on why i think what’s she’s been saying is bullshit, how her way of life seems like “a religion for atheism” (i’m very proud of this line) and basically how we’ve invented concepts of doing things for our soul and true self because we continue to grasp for meaning in a meaningless world just like religious people grasp for god to give them meaning. tbh i expected her to argue back and be like no you’re wrong but she just was like yeah i guess that’s your truth. shit made me feel hopeless asf because i was like now i’m even more loss for meaning. but i’m kinda pissed at her tho, after losing the argument she was like oh yeah btw i’m gonna tell your parents that you have means and plan to kms. which hella confused me because i didn’t and i said that and she was like nvm no. i was like bruh you’re fr tryna scare me. so now i think my therapist is speaking full of shit but it’s been one session; if this continues i’m dropping her. i’m kinda annoyed that she lowkey threatened me to send me back to a psych ward, maybe i’m projecting too much but it really seemed unprofessional. i cried

but fr tho i appreciate how she’s tryna support me, it’s nice how nice she is to me. i tried to make this other ring and it looked ass and i got pissed. but making rings is addicting and fun tbh. but i got pissed and feel empty. today sucked a lot of ass, i felt like shit the entire day basically. i was supposed to have family therapy but the zoom call didn’t work so it got moved to thursday. which is annoying but whatever. still feeling fucking empty as shit. i’m stuck in this abyss of darkness. at this point i’m considering not going to school tomorrow. but i probably should. idk fuck. i was so happy for 5 days and now i’m just here. just wanting to die. because i’m not enough for myself. i honestly don’t know when was the last time i wanted to be myself. my mind is always telling myself ways i can be better. now i don’t even love myself. that’s why when i’m depressed i’m always so desperate for a relationship. because i’m replacing my lack of self love with someone else’s. it feels good in the moment but it always fades away. it feels like i’m on this journey alone, i spend so much time alone with my thoughts. but i don’t want to keep fighting against my thoughts. i just want to accept them and let them destroy me. because i’m sick of fighting. it’s so tempting to throw my whole fucking life away. because it’s so worthless. everytime i think about cutting a lot of me just wants to inflict that pain onto myself. like i’m punishing myself for being a pire of shit. like a sadistic masochist. it’s crazy how i don’t treat myself human. the value i have for myself is so low and worthless. i constantly bully myself, critique who i am and harm myself in the name of being better. it’s fucked, if i were to say the things i say to myself to others i’d get arrested for hate speech. whatever man. i don’t want to think anymore</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

makes me depressed and happy at the same time. i still have some photos of my ex and sc because i couldn’t delete them. looking over them make me remind me of what i had with angel, and how committed she was to me. the passion of our youthful love was irrational but meaningful. but now that commitment scares me; giving my all to someone just seems like something i can’t do anymore. finding someone to give my all too seems even harder. honestly i see myself having a bunch of casual relationships and hookups because of the fact that i won’t commit. but maybe i was committing too much to angel, to the point where i was losing my own individuality. yeah that makes more sense. it feels like i’m constantly fine tuning myself to be someone better, but it’s not very rewarding, constantly changing makes me question my identity and it’s so exhausting. also i don’t know when i will stop and just accept who i am. everything about me just seems like a complex enigma. i always looked down on people that refused to change but now i question whether constantly changing is good. i think i am changing too much, i remember growing up and always having to be the one that matures when i was the kid. i always had to change and never really got to spend my childhood and immaturity. but i also never trusted people to change either, and i always believed that if i wanted a relationship i needed to do all the changing. the truth is i can’t do everything myself. so to go back to what i thought about with angel, i did commit too much but she also was needy and asked too much from me. that exhausted me and lose my individuality. but who knows maybe i’m just rationalizing a breakup that happened 6 months ago. but i think after the dust settled, i see what i was feeling and thinking more clearly. school wasn’t bad today but when i got home i felt like shit. i thought about cutting today but i didn’t. i also thought about sling drugs to subsidize the pain, i have a lot of fantasies about harming myself to relieve the pain. something is making me feel undeserving of love, i’m not really sure what it is.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

because i tried different things and they all failed. i have this acne on my stomach and it’s so annoying because it gets irritated so easily. i’m not ready to back to school tomorrow, i’m really used to my daily schedule. but i gotta do what i gotta do. semester 2 is really light tho so we should be chilling. it’s my first semester without math which is a blessing. realized i don’t have to bring a calculator. i also have art 10 which should be pretty fun and chill. but i’ve memed the shit out of the class by saying i’m going to get an art 10 art hoe even though i really know that’s not going to happen 😃😃😃. yk when you say a joke too much you start believing it? but on a different note, i feel like i just realized i put way too much effort into my relationship with angel. like thinking about how much i grinded is crazy. like i was grinding school badminton and putting my all into my relationship, no wonder i burned out. but i also felt like i put too much in, i feel like i was forcing myself to be really committed to her when my feelings weren’t really there. like i was trying to convince myself of a lie by living it. honestly not really worth, thinking about how much effort i put into my life and how little time i had for myself and my social life is saddening. i always say this because my opinion always differs depending on my mood, but i genuinely think my life is better without a relationship. like the attention is nice and all but i already have such nice friends around me that i wouldn’t really want to give that time away for a relationship. i’m enjoying the time alone and my independence tbh. which is honestly a first. i always think that my life would be better with a relationship, in general i’d always be future thinking about how good my life will be. but now my attitude has changed, i think about things i can do rn to make me happy. i think i’ve been happier this last week, i don’t remember my last breakdown. which is honestly a lot of progress. yeah, i’ve been feeling a lot better. that makes me happy to know. i think i’m slowly finding my footing in life.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

something paid $25 for me. i didn’t even get to thank him because i didn’t see him. it’s hype how he told the cashier to give me $25 from him so i’m super fucking grateful. and then i bought some bead stuff from this store in the middle of nowhere. and then i went home. then i went out again with amina ben kai and emma. we played cards against humanity for like a hour which was okay. but we played truth or dare which was hype. here’s me sitting in a dog crate with amina. but theres a lot of embarrassing videos that idk if i will post because i don’t want to embarrass amina and emma too much

the second one is good tho, i’m proud of it. it took me a lot less time. i also cleaned my room today and potted my plants. they look really nice but i gotta start thinking about where i want to put them. it’s also nice cleaning the depression mess. i also did my social final today. so today was actually really productive. but other then that final none of it really felt like work. i think i genuinely enjoyed my day and was happy throughout. i’m pretty hype to go snowboarding tomorrow, it’s been a long ass time. i gotta use my sisters snowboard and shoes cause i grew out of mine. it’s also crazy how much i love music. but rn i feel like such a pick me guy. i fucking scroll pinterest and make jewelry. i dress like pinterest guys. i’m becoming a libtard. i have vinyl. and most importantly i’m not attractive. if i did all these things and was attractive i wouldn’t be considered a pick me. but it’s really a struggle out here. i’m basically a nice guy now. pain. i’m gonna stop

man. i honestly just wanted a space where i can be open and talk about things openly and we can go through issues together. but this mf counsellor wants to “strengthen the relationship” which is honestly super FUCKING unreasonable for me. i’ve considered if i sound entitled but i’ve concluded that this is the truth about it all. because i’m too exhausted to be strengthening a relationship with my parents. first of all, i need to take care of my own mental health. like i’ve been focusing on myself this entire time but now i need to do this. i’m genuinely too exhausted for that. second of all, i completely don’t trust my parents at all to be capable to do this. i’ve seen them fail over and over again when i’ve told them what i wanted. they haven’t earned my faith to trust them. because they continue to believe they are entitled to this faith and trust. but they need to earn that shit. finally, i still need time to process everything they’ve done to me in the past. because if i’m being honest thinking about what i had to do for them pisses me off. i had to mature myself for my parents, when i’m the fucking kid. and they ask to help them when i had to figure all of it myself when i was a kid. the way my parents are treating me rn is sustainable for me and i’m happy with it. if they want to further the relationship, it’s up to them to do so without my guidance. because currently i’m in no state to help them nor do i want to. also the fucking therapist never takes my side and it pisses me off. i swear this woman is just tryna appeal to my parents. i’m fucking done with her shit. because she fucking insists doing all of this when i don’t want to do it. and i think my reasons are completely valid. thinking about this shit makes me so genuinely angry and depressed. because she doesn’t actually care. all she does is follow her fucking protocol like it’s a treatment but doesn’t understand that every family is fucking different. AND THE FUCKING FACT THAT SHE IS ONLY APPEALING TO MY PARENTS PISSES ME OFF.

naps throughout the days to catch up. i hate this. i just want to sleep in. also i don’t get as much serotonin taking naps anymore so that sucks. i’m gonna see a dermatologist soon. shostakovich is the goat producer. i watched a video on him and how he basically talked shit about stalin in his symphonies even though stalin had a really tight hold on art and lowkey almost killed him. anyways i’m just really tired today, did some social. i’ve just been napping all day which is kinda bad but idk what to do. my head kinda hurts from sleeping too much.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

which was nice. then i went to the bead store with grace and shits so expensive. it was really dope shopping with her. and then we went to a plant store and bought Gerald. i also bought this ring for $5. but hanging out with grace was really fun :))). plus Gerald is apparently a fortune plant. i brought it home and my dad was saying how you buy this plant every chinese new year for good fortune. which is super dope to me, i happened to buy this plant during around chinese new years. it’s god telling me i have good fortune. and we have one at home which is like 10x bigger then the one i bought. anyways i also hung out with howard and we just sat in my room and talked and listened to music. that was just nice to do. after that i played skyblock with howard and richard for like 3 hours. pretty dope. i also walked my dog twice and i think i want a dog in the future. walking with totoro is honestly nice and not as bad as i thought. still want a cat. overall today was really fun

and insecure for no reason man. i hâte myself. anyways i went to my theorist appointment and i cried. it was okay. not really. i cried about my parents. realizing that i might not be able to fix everything. realizing that i still have so much to do even though i’ve been through hell for this. realizing that i never got to be a kid to my parents. i would get into these useless arguments with my parents and i had to act like a fucking adult. i had to change who i was. they never changed for me. i always had to change. the only time they were even opening to change i had to show them that i was willing to put my life on the fucking line. and now, it’s all happening again. they go back to old habits, forgetting everything and i am the one that pays. i was always the one changing and they just lived their lives in ignorance. i just wanted to live as a kid. i didn’t want to change, i wanted to be happy with who i am and not always question whether or not i should’ve done that. blame myself for things that were other peoples fault. fuck man when will i be happy. when does it end. life is just so fucking hard. i honestly don’t want to do this shit anymore. fuck this. i want to fucking throw away my life and become a crack addict to convince myself to die. i’m just so done with this shit man. i came home and just played gta v for too long. i just wanted to escape from this shit. and now i don’t even feel sane. it’s been a long time since i’ve done something meaningful. i wish somebody was here to tell me everything will be okay. i’m tired of this. i continually challenge and change who i am just for my family and they won’t do the same. all my effort just seems to be going to waste. all my years of fighting for change. when am i enough? when is it over? i just want to be enough. i fucking hate myself. i just ask for too much. i’m just too needy. fuck me man, all these emotions running through my head. it’s been 3 days of breakdowns.</div><div

_a6-i">YO I FINISHED KY STUDYING GRIND. i feel pretty fucking good. i have shit tons of adrenaline running in my veins, when i’m in the zone studying it’s me studying for 45 min and then jamming out to music for 5 minutes. fuck this unit tho. apparently there’s one probability question so i’m gonna do that tmmrw. but that’s such a god blessing. anyways today was really fun, i hung out with grace today which was genuinely really nice. we haven’t hung out in a long time. i copped this long ass jacket and other thing. it’s hype. i also got my sister something. but hanging out with her realized i’m just really grateful for all my friends bro. i couldn’t really do all this without you guys. sometimes i think about the things you guys did for me and it makes me really happy. it actually warms my heart. so thank you all of you. also i know i was talking about this yesterday but i’m genuinely so proud of myself. like i went through so much emotional grief. so much. and it may not be completely over, but like i really did that shit man. the best part is the i did everything. i had support that i’m forever grateful of but the reality is i did everything to change the reality i was living into the reality i wanted. and even rn. like this week is really similar to the week i attempted. i had an essay, and two tests. last time i couldn’t handle all the pressure and attempted suicide. but this time, i’m grinding it out. and that progression is just crazy to think about. it makes me so happy realizing that i’m fighting now. i don’t want to give up anymore. and that makes me so fucking happy. plus i enjoyed this study session. it’s just crazy how much progress i’m making. and that makes me really happy. it might seem not that major but too me this is super fucking major. also thinking about the people that has been sticking with me since day one makes wanna cry. they were there through the worst stage of my life. idek how i can show my gratitude.</div><div

learn everything tomorrow and that doesn’t seem reasonable at all. i think i can get away with it too, everyone knows i’m suicidal asf. maybe the unit test will also be no jeopardy because i would most likely do it next week. we will see tho. my therapist lowkey spends a lot of time just boosting my ego. but maybe i just don’t really want to accept it so i don’t become too egotistical. but what she said made me really happy today. i mean the reality is i’ve changed everything around me and myself to make me feel better about my own life and mental health. as bad as this sounds, a major motivation for my suicide attempt was the need for my parents to understand. over the years i’ve been always trying to tell them how i want to be treated but never got those results. these arguments were hurtful asf and honestly it lead to this very desperate attention seeking action. though it caused a lot of pain for the people around me, it’s changed so much of my families dynamic that i genuinely feel so proud that i was able to change my family for the better. i feel so rewarded that my voice was heard and finally expressed. there’s a lot of things i changed about myself, i don’t mind asking for help or for people to be more flexible. albeit i do take advantage of my depression for that. i definitely respect my own feelings and desires more. my whole outlook on how i want to live life has changed. i honestly can proudly say that i changed so much about my life and myself that ive taken myself out of depression. well i wouldn’t say i’m not depressed anymore, i still am. but i’m proud of myself that i did that. i changed my life, changed my family and changed my minfset. ofc i couldn’t do alone tho. a lot of this change came from your guys support and i’m forever thankful for that. without your support i wouldn’t be able to do this. so i owe my life to all of you. quite literally too. it feels good. that being said i feek pretty dreadful today. i didn’t get much work done, just ended up napping. i feel pretty bad about that. but in general i’m just suddenly extremely anxious about my future.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

and i feel like my brain is super huge. that being said i’m feeling very unconfident about my essay, i think my question is too general that it’s detracting from the entirety of my essay. which sucks cause i put so much work in already. and i really like all the objections i said, they seem more complex then my previous essay. idk tho i might just bomb this essay. bruh i thinking about this essay rn and i want to right more fuck. philosophy is actually so rewarding wtf. i actually feel so rewarded thinking about this shit. might actually pursue phil in the future. but yeah i genuinely feel so rewarded. i peed like 20 times today because i drank so much coffee and tea to be productive. it worked out tho, i got so much work done and i feel really good about it. it feels really good knowing that i still can work hard when i really need to, maybe i haven’t lost my edge yet. but lowkey it’s cause i actually want to do phil. i’ve been really motivated to write this essay and it’s very enjoyable to do. but very draining. incredibly draining on the mind. okay goodnight everyone. i want to write my phil essay still but whatever</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

being socially isolated and not sustainable. i really don’t want to live my life where i spend 20 hours in my house. i miss talking to a lot of my friends too, everyone’s been too busy to call and have fun. even so, i feel my mental health has improved the last couple of days. i feel better about life in general. that being said i’m seriously lamenting at the fact that i can’t do work for shit. i wrote like two paragraphs for my philosophy essay today. i just can’t seem to be productive anymore. also i took two naps for whatever reason. though i feel better i feel like such a useless piece of shit. i can’t seem to do any work and it’s so frustrating to see me do that. i had such a passion and motivation to do school and now i can’t even focus for a hour. and i’m constantly tired, no amount of sleep can fix it. my depression is just so draining. i don’t even know who i am anymore, i feel like such a different person. i feel like i definitely lost my free will, i’m just so guy run by his depression. but i mean maybe i shouldn’t define who i am as a person based on my productiveness. but still it’s hard, i’ve done it all my life. plus it’s easy to define yourself on something external rather than internal. because that’s just the way society is designed, we praise and expect the external, we rarely give a shit about the internal. soon with how the world is going we will just be robots working at our jobs trying to progress our country ahead of others. of course we’re going to make much of our identity’s on our grades, that’s what we get praised for. isn’t that just so sad to see tho, nobody cares about who we actually are. but i need to be productive or im ducked for school</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

was one of the cheapest records i bought and it has the highest quality. no cap the worst quality is mbdtf. shit is bent and one of the disks lowkey don’t play. very sad. anyways today was good no breakdown or lowness today. i didn’t do any work, i always say i’m going to but end up procrastinating and not doing shit. i want to do work with other people so i feel more accountable to do it. i’ve added two records to my vinyl wall and they are pretty. i hung out with howard and it’s pretty fun. we went to record stores sifting through their catalog. i was tryna parallel park and i hit

essay. i think i know the topic, it’s basically just being like is existentialism better then nihilism or in general what’s the meaning of life. shits gonna be hard asf when i think about it, there’s so many arguments running through my head. also it’s a dumbass move trying to write about something none of the examples wrote about. but nevertheless i’ll try and really i’m lowkey the most well versed in the meaning of life cause that shit is all i think about nowadays. plus i’m lowkey just writing it for myself so i know whether i want to live or die. but also the existentialist argument i am going for is super fucking complex and i’m like bruh what am i doing. along with that i’m using another album to be my non philosophical source, just because i can’t think of any other source. hopefully i can actually do good on this essay, the ethics one is like a 1000x easier. but idk we will see how it plays out. other than that life is okay rn, lowkey had a breakdown. lowkey having breakdowns everyday but hopefully it’ll be good</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video src="media/posts/202101/514DCE469F8F631EF49324456523C880_video_dashinit_17856470897433538.mp4" controls="1"

was a mess but nice. she actually understands me and it’s nice talking to her. but there’s a lot of things she’s been saying that’s kinda bugging me. first of all she said i’m going through my mid life crisis early 😃😃😃😃. like she was like yeah these are the questions and things people in their mid life crisis ask. like what is happiness, why am i here blah blah blah. which is kinda funny to me. i’m a 40 year old i guess. maybe all the stress has aged my brain that much 😃. but half of therapy for me is just talking about existentialism. it’s honestly nice but kinda stupid. okay this next part i don’t want to sound egotistical, don’t let whatever i say change your perception of me. but my therapist has been saying a lot that i’m brilliant and that’s why i’m going through my mid life crisis so early. she said that i’m going through all of this so that i’ll be able to live a life that i want to live in the future. she said that other people don’t have these thoughts until much later in my life and that it’s happening to me because i’m not normal. she said my brilliance will cultivate a really good life. this isn’t the first time she’s been saying this. maybe she’s just sucking me off but i mean what’s the point of calling me smart, i don’t think she’s the one to boost my ego. so assuming what’s she been saying is true, me being “brilliant” is causing me to be depressed.  that realization made me cry a bit. because honestly all i want to be is normal and happy man. when she told me i wasn’t normal it felt like shit. because now i have to carve my own way of life. but also because my abnormalities are causing me so much fucking pain. i want to be normal so i can be happy. all this pain that’s been inflicted onto me is from my brilliance? i don’t want to be fucking smart anymore then. so basically all i’m saying is since i’m naturally good at philosophy it makes me hella depressed. i’m trying not to sound like a piece of shit rn. but it makes me feel like shit that one of the most admirable parts of myself creates so much turmoil and pain within me.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video

fantasies 😍😍😍😍. okay, idek where this rant is going. i feel like i’m not trying g hard enough to be happy. maybe it’s me not trusting my emotions but i mean everyone tells me to be happy by doing all these things. the only person that’s accepted my feelings is my therapist and maybe one or two other people. everyone else seems to think there’s some other way i can outthink my feelings. maybe they’re right, maybe i should just be happy, the worlds telling me that. fuck this. fuck being raised so i can’t be content. i just want to be fucking happy man. all i fucking want. it feels like the world failed me raising me. but maybe i’ve just failed myself. maybe i’m too fucking stupid to understand fucking emotions. how can mothwrfuckwrs be so content while i sit here and want to kms everyday. i have everything i could possibly need now and i still feel like the shit on the bottom of your shoe. fuck man i have no fucking resilience i don’t know how to appreciate shit and i’m just a piece of shit. fuck me. i hâte myself. fuck this. here’s me not loving myself again. how can i expect to be happy when i treat myself like shit. but a part of me believes i deserve this shit. for being a pussy or something. for being a waste of time and effort. i’m never enough for myself. i wasted my entire day. i’m a piece of shit. everyday is a war inside my head.</div><div class="_3-95

stars and they were really pretty and they were lots of them. jasper is like one of the best place to go look at the stars. but honestly i just didn’t really enjoy it. i try my best to appreciate life and be happy and want to live but i always seem to fail. it’s honestly kinda sad and painful. i just want to actually appreciate my life and i never can. i can’t even appreciate the pretty stars. also i realized how distant i feel with my family. it’s actually years of us tearing our relationship apart that we’re so distant it’s honestly depressing. and because of all this i still have an infatuation with a relationship. just because i was happy with one i automatically assume it will solve all my problems. i also think that it’s a good enough replacement for my torn relationship with my parents. i’m just so mentally unhealthy. when it comes down to it the person i feel closest to my family is literally my dog. how sad is that. and he’s a big dummy, he’s such a bad boy all the time. but whatever i love him. how can i love a dog so much and not love my parents. damn, i really failed at this life thing.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

times but it’s so much adrenaline and just so much fun. then we went shopping after, i bought gifts for my friend. i won’t say their name so you guys can be like omgggggg is it me? and then because you think i got you a gift you’ll buy me a gift because you feel bad but in reality i didn’t and i got a free gift. so basically i bought all of you guys gifts and you should buy gifts back. jk don’t actually. the chances of me buying you a gift is very low so yeah. today i did a little bit of walking but since i’ve been sitting on my ass all day my legs are absolutely exhausted. at the end of the day the only thing that really fills with me energy and happiness is hanging out with friends. hanging out with howard is so braindead but genuinely one of the things that keep me alive. not to sound needy or bad but i mean i would be dead without the people on my spam. as bad as this sounds i don’t think i would be alive if i only had my family. that’s why i always ask to hangout, just cause that’s the only thing that really makes me happy. i feel really guilty about some of the things i said today. i don’t really see my life as valuable ig. plus i feel like i go through so many thoughts of self harm, suicide and generally throwing my life away that it’s exhausting. i don’t want to keep on experiencing these things. everyday for me is a new battle and i don’t want to wake up anymore. i have to battle myself everyday, my expectations and other people expectations. i have to value moments that genuinely make me happy highly or i would just give in. i think my mood is slightly better but i’m so exhausted i want to give in. also i’m not excited to be with my family for 5 days ngl. i just want some alone time and yeah i’m going to have spend time with them in a cabin. i just kinda want to stay home and finally get some time away from them so i can just feel better. plus jasper is a 5 hour drive like bruh. i genuinely don’t want to go, i know christmas is about family but i’ve never really felt close to them. the love they give me feels so forced and i feel</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

napped during my spare today but overslept and woke up when there was 20 minutes left of philosophy. oopsies. i need to find things to do, the only thing i really do other then waste my time on youtube and tiktok is play mc and grind music. like thinking about how much time i spend watching youtube videos of music and shit is stupid. i don’t even listen to music that much, i just do a lot of things that are about it. i’m gonna burnout fuck lmao. i feel better about my family, still a little distant but better. my therapist is on winter break so i’ll go for about 3 weeks without seeing her. which honestly sucks a lot. i honestly feel so weak tho. i feel like every asian kid has parents who don’t support them emotionally and are a lot worse then mine. there are so many kids with worst situations then mine, fuck being asian kid is basically a culture of having unsupportive parents. but why did i get so depressed? why do i feel all these emotions. some part of me wants to keep pushing through and grind my life away because that’s all i’ve ever known. but i’ll just end up hating my life. i’ve been having lots of intrusive thoughts even tho my mood isn’t worse. tbh i think the antidepressants or semi working. i feel slightly more energetic and my mood is better, the change is def not dramatic at all. but i have these thoughts that just come. i guess they are me fantasizing about doing fuck shit to myself. a common theme ig is that i want to just destroy my body, almost to show the world how torn up my soul is. just to physically represent how i feel about myself. these imaginations always come up when i especially feel down but generally have been coming a lot when i feel okay. i really want to succumb to drugs or self harm tbh. a part of me wants to throw my life away so i can convince myself that i truly don’t feel like living. one day i’ll look in the mirror teeth falling out, addicted to drugs and scars everywhere and decide leaving. there’s a constant war in my head of what reality i want to live in. a constant war of finding out whether i want to live or die. the problem is the war seems is the biggest struggle.</div><div class="_3-95

because i need some space. i feel like my mom is just trying to force herself into my life. i really just want space away from them. everything feels so forced when they show me love and honestly their really just forcing things. it feels so unnatural and just not what i need. it also feels like they’re disregarding the fact i want space so yeah. fuck quarantine i need space away from my parents. i didn’t do shit today, i took a 2.5 hour nap which was nice. i have no idea what to do at night, i could do hw but i’m too lazy. there’s nothing for me to do so ig i need to find things to do now. i’ve been doing lots of hard work when it comes to music, reading lyrics, reading reviews and analysis and having hard listens. it’s pretty exhausting tho and i feel like could be more fulfilling. overall idk if i feel better, the emotions are a lot less hard hitting but i generally just in a mood of disdain. along with that my thoughts have become really intrusive and lowkey worse even tho i don’t feel as bad. ngl i’m really out here fantasizing fucking my life over and taking drugs. my dog is sick rn and hearing him cough kinda breaks my heart. ngl rn i spend the most time with him then anyone else in my family. petting him is just so rewarding and he’s so cute and i just stare at him a lot making faces. as much as a dog is asshole to me by literally eating the food off my plate when he has a chance, i love him. honestly i like when he does dumb things like that because it’s kinda adorable and funny. i can’t be mad at this stupid guy. like yeah maybe i should be more strict but idk man i want him to feel my unconditional love. which is probably because i didn’t really feel that unconditional love growing up and i want to give it to my children (if i ever have kids). basically i treat totoro as my kid. he gets my unconditional love. recently i like him a lot more, i think he was too energetic before so i didn’t like hanging out with him. now around me he’s calm and just takes his pets like the good boy he is. that being said he’s a bad boy all the time. this guy so so desperate for food.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

FUCKING ALBUM. like i honestly feel so emotionally drained rn just because of all the emotions that this album projected on me. it’s such a dark album and it has such an abstract but effective way of just making you feel these hard hitting emotions. like i felt so anxious and just in danger listening to this. the album explores themes of childish innocence and how that innocence is removed by the world. but bro i literally sat down and completely concentrated on listening to this album. it’s 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it was so worth it. the concept is really abstract and obscure but i’m going to try to explain what i think it is. basically it’s a soundtrack for a film that doesn’t exist. but really when you listen to the album the film exists within you and you’re the protagonist. i found myself exploring myself and i guess the inner workings of myself. this album also says that the sense blocks us from understanding the truths of the world because our sense only perceives. that being said i think the album is trying to convey that the truth is conveyed through our emotions. what makes us blind is our senses. idk tho maybe i’m deriving too much meaning from an album that’s 99% instrumentals. but the environment that is created and the world that is created is so amazing. like just through sound alone this entire world is created and it’s amazing. it made me so emotional too, i found myself lost in the darkness multiple times in this album. along with that, this album knows when to create this tension and when to create relaxation. i was so close to crying so many times. i think this album pushes the boundaries of art and is so unique and creative. it’s a 10/10 for me this album is amazing i love this album already and it’s been one listen. anyways i actually need to play mc at night because i end up listening to a 2 hour album LOL. on the real tho i constantly have nothing i look forward to other then playing mc. quarantine sucks major dick cause i really need space away from my family. they suck at giving me space and i really need alone time just because idk that’s what i need.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

thinking about removing someone but it’ll create so much drama LMAO. now all you guys can be insecure wondering if it is you. my therapist said that i should be naturally good at philosophy. but on the real tho i actually love talking to my therapist, i feel so reassured. idk man now that i think about it there’s been a lot of shitty things that’s been happening. there’s been major conflicts with me and everyone else. it’s exhausting to deal with honestly. as bad as this sounds i never see a future where i feel comfortable opening up to my parents. i feel like i’m becoming distant to my family, feeling like my trust has been breached so many times by everyone that i genuinely don’t want to interact with them anymore. as my therapist says, they don’t deserve my trust. but honestly the words they’ve said to me have been really hurtful and just high key disregarding my feelings. they acting like i’m choosing to be depressed. they acting like i would be happy if i just did these simple things. a big part of me has just given up. but honestly i’m not going to put effort in anymore. if they want to repair the relationship they have to earn my trust. i feel so drained and my therapist supports everything i say so i’m going to trust her. overall tho, i trust my therapist a lot, even tho i was questioning her a lot i think after going thru those questions i trust her more. and if she says something and it makes sense i’ll do it. and rn i think i’m doing what she wants, but more importantly what i need to do emotionally. so yeah i’m going to try to honour myself as much as possible even tho i face a lot backlash because of it</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

shit all day tbh. i’m honestly really done with my parents. like i’m just so tired of everything that i honestly just given up on trying to fix the relationship. they never really learn. like i remember they went on my phone and i got mad asf at the for invading my privacy and was super mad. but now i confronted my mom about listening to my psychiatrist appointments and she admitted that she’s been listening to my private appointments. like bruh imagine how many therapist appointments she was listening to like bruh. idk man how do you expect me to trust you when you said you wouldn’t invade my privacy again 😐😐😐😐😐. i just feel so fucking violated man, like these appointments are private for a reason. it’s just so fucking annoying how they expect me to open up and trust them when they just pull shit like this. like honestly wtf. and it’s like everyone tells them to do something but all i hear them doing is not doing what they learned. like bruh i said i don’t want to hear advice and they still out here giving it 😐😐😐. like i genuinely have never felt them empathize with me and they expect me to open up. i fucking hate it. it’s everything again. they just keep on expecting shit. i always have these expectations that i have to fill and it’s so fucking stupid. honestly they treat me like a fucking toy man. they expect so much shit and it just never fucking stops. i just never feel like they actually treat me like a real human, it feels like they just treat me like a robot. nothing is done on my own terms. my own trust for them is not even on my terms. it’s just so fucking stupid how they just don’t understand basic human relationships man. i just want to be treated like a person. not like a fucking child or like a fucking robot. i wish i didn’t feel this way but honestly i’ve become so mentally exhausted from our relationship that i just feel no attachment. like i can’t bring it in me to feel any emotional attachment to these people. i feel like i should but i can’t do it.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video src="media/posts/202012/FQIoAkMzLBdAGXbItDlYEBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB16gcA_18138642415121637" controls="1" class="_a6_o

i can’t tell if i’m genuinely tired or want to escape from life. i’m tired still so i’m going probably sleep through the night. anyways, hanging out with friends was pretty good but today was pretty shit. my parents invaded my privacy again so i’m just like bruh okay do you want me to trust you or not. then my dad had a brain dead argument with me basically being like since you lie in bed all day you become more depressed. like bruh i lie in bed all day because i want to escape from my life. it def feels like they’ve taken like 20 steps back bro. but tbh i’m too lazy to fix shit at this point. a big part of me wants to go the downward spiral of the pitfalls of life because i want to convince myself to die. i’ve been trying to convince myself to live and that’s just so much work. it’s so much easier to be nihilistic and be like life sucks and i don’t want to live it i’m done with this shit. along with that i’ve just stopped giving a shit about life. like what if i become a drug addict. then i’ll just die bro. my life is an option and will always be an option. i feel like the emotional pain i go through on a daily basis just wants a conclusion, either i want to live content or i die. but it’s so hard to live content so i need to convince myself the other option. okay i’m done with this rant this probably is a really bad rant i shouldn’t say lmao. you don’t need to be concerned i don’t have plan or intent so don’t send me to the hospital. i’m just kinda hopeless rn, being content and happy feel so impossible. the struggle of holding on is getting the better of me. i don’t want the struggle anymore, i just want the conclusion, whatever that may be. also my dose increased another 10 mg cause the antidepressants have been useless</div><div class="_3-95

analyzed lyrics for like two songs and i’m like bruh. it’s tiring asf tho. i sleep so much in the day it’s kinda bad. i just want christmas break to come so i can not feel so burnt out. life isn’t horrible rn but idk i feel like soon it’ll become worse. just how my life flows. also i idealize girls way too hard it’s bad. but i mean living idealized scenarios with girls you don’t have a chance with is a coping mechanism for the pain of living 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍. also it’s crazy that every religion says that life is suffering unless you follow my beliefs.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video

that i just lied in bed to escape. i napped to escape and overall i just do a lot of things to escape. my parents were talking about life 10 years for now and when i was thinking about all the issues and the future of humanity being in my hands, i was like bro i don’t even want to be alive in the future. the only thing that makes me happy are social interactions. i actually feel genuinely happy when i talk to people but since quarantine started, there’s been a heavy lack of that. it’s weighing on my mental health a lot. but lowkey i’m less free then everyone else because i take antidepressants 😎😎. it’s so hard to describe how it feels to be me, actually it’s impossible. after 170 spam posts i still can’t. understanding is so hard and i hate it. everything is so hard and i just hope one day i’ll be content and fulfilled or dead.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

man. just like i have no passions in my life. like bruh i just want to do something with passion. actually i just want to live without wanting to die everyday. i can’t get my life in check, i can’t take care of myself for shit. and now making decisions is so hard, i have no idea what i’m doing anymore. i’m just so fucking lost man. just in the middle of a ocean gasping for air. i just don’t know what to do. there’s just such a deep passion to die, asking myself if i want to live is a daily task. fuck this man, living like this isn’t living at all. where is all this emotional labour coming from. why am i like this. how is my life so fucking hard. i try so hard to just be content and it just doesn’t work. these fucking antidepressants haven’t done shit. just nothing works. all the help i’ve received has just gone to waste. i feel like such a failure man. i have everything and i still can’t be happy. i still have these pounding thoughts of death in my head and i’ve received so much support. will i ever be fixed? will there ever be a me that will happy? or will i be constantly thirsting for happiness but never receive it. there’s nothing more anybody else can do for me. i feel so useless, i can’t even do the things people do with their eyes closed. why did i end up like this, what did i fuck up? lately my anxiety has been worse, i begun to worry irrationally about things. i feel like i’m worsening instead of being better. i feel like everyone sucks at supporting me but the reality is i’m too broken for support to do anything. i’ve taken so many punches i just want to fall down. i don’t want to keep standing up. just give in.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202012/D447575366DBCFF7E3684FA8AF820694_video_dashinit_17875328012042164.mp4"

questioning my therapist because she’s changing a lot of the perspective i have if my life and i’m like bruh am i getting gaslighted LOL. but idk in general i’m treading into unknown territory and because it’s so new and unknown it’s scary. also that unknown territory is actually just trusting yourself and how you feel. it kinda sounds pathetic that this is so unknown to me but honestly it’s so scary. at the same time, idk who to trust man. all my life i’ve never really done this, i just trusted the people who told me what to do and i guess the logic but i’ve always ignored my emotions. now that i’m trying to trust how i feel it’s such a struggle for me, it’s so unknown and i become defensive to this change. it’s honestly scary. along with that i have to trust my therapist. she’s leading me to this new place and i feel that because of that i become super anxious and i rationalize this anxiety by demonizing her. i literally was like bruh what if you were gaslighting me and i just didn’t know LOL. i’m genuinely so anxious tho, for as long as i lived i’ve never really trusted myself and always tried to push myself. now that i am i feel like i’m doing something wrong. like i should just be pushing myself. along with this, everything was working until this year, maybe i shouldn’t change my beliefs. idk tho i think my therapist was right, idk why i kept on trying to live someone else’s life when i control the reigns. it’s just so hard to trust her when everything about you is questioned. that’s the hard part. the way i lived, the way i am and the ways i have found success are all being questioned. it’s so much to sift through and to process because even though i think change is good, i don’t want to blindly believe in her. i esp don’t like it when i’m like bruh what if i’m getting gaslighted. idk man i think she’s right, the way i was living was nkt sustainable and was not how i wanted to live my life. yeah she’s right. but it’s so familiar i don’t want to leave it. all the things i thought were me are being questioned. but i just think i need to accept change in my life.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

want to do more. it’s pretty and having my interests spread on my room makes me happy. i played mc with ben, amina and howard for a long time. mc is fun but idk it’s hard to get addicted to it. i always end up getting too tired to play for longer then 2 hours. today wasn’t that good but something resolved itself and i’m super happy about it. i feel reassured about it so hopefully this won’t happen again because idk if i’ll be able to take it. i’m really happy about that tho :)). i didn’t do anything productive other then clean my room but whatever. i need to grind physics tomorrow but whatever. i also want to change my bed and shit but idk if i will get to that. i feel like recently my mood has been a lot worse. just a lot more lows and the lows have been bad. it just sucks man. the antidepressants haven’t really kicked in yet i think, i still feel relatively the same. lowkey really want to go to my therapist appointment so i can talk about what’s been happening. then i can get a professional opinion 😎. but idk i feel like she says very productive things and i’m like yeah you’re right. the one thing that irks me about her is how she acts when you first meet her, her

the night i overdosed. i legit was thinking about dying the entire time i was finishing that fucking essay. literally what the fuck. i swear wutzke is just giving me pity marks bro, half of the essay was so fucking bad. there’s no way i actually popped off what the fuck. anyways today was okay, i feel good about the exam i wrote (not amazing tho) but at least i weote it. i feel pretty dog shit after hanging out with friends, guess my mood decided to swing. i’m hella clueless about this one situation, at this point i’ve already accepted it. whatever man. i’m doing some toxic shit just to cope with the pain, you’ll be disappointed if i say what. whatever man. thinking about ending it ig. life just isn’t going my way. i just want to succumb to my immaturity and just yell and cuss ppl out but unfortunately i’m not going to. fuck lmao i just hate my life bro. i seriously can’t do school anymore, i have no motivation. school is so fucking painful man. i just want closure in this situation, i’m really confused but i’ve accepted it. i just want to know why everything is happening and just know what you want out of us so i don’t have to disrupt you anymore. idk if you’re even gonna read this but i just want to talk man. i just want communication. maybe i’m being overly insecure but there’s no way you decided to do this for the reasons stated.</div><div class="_3-95

just spent the entire day being numb in my bed. didn’t bother going to school. probably not going to bother going tomorrow because i have not read the life you can save and we have a fucking exam on it. i don’t even feel like ranting. i sleep a lot to disconnect from reality. my room is just escapism. i spend all day stuffing my face with snacks just to cope. i eat little in meals, it’s too much work. i can’t even cry, i’m just numb as hell. my head hurts so much i can’t even process what’s happening. i’m just lying in bed listening to music. in order to feel a sense of productiveness i’m literally just listening to so much music and trying to process as much albums as possible. but idk. i’m just numb as hell. i try to cry so i can feel better but all i can feel is numbness. is this the doing of my antidepressants? i just feel alone. just feel like a burden. like i’m on my deathbed. i don’t do anything but just lie down. i’m oversharing just so more people can pity my life. i’m so pathetic. does anybody even care? maybe i’m just crazy or disillusioned. but fuck man it’s hard to believe when i have so much evidence. i don’t want to do school anymore. i can’t take it. my life is a mess. my rooms a mess, my bathroom is a mess, i’m a mess. do people even read these rants. the world is honestly better without me. the evidence is just too clear. my head hurts. i can’t escape

bed and overall clean it. yesterday i read one of my rants on my notes. reading it showed me how low i go. i’m really living life where i’m giving myself so much emotional trauma. the things i said were real thoughts but were so horrific to read lowkey. but i thought about it for a bit and i believe them. i want to everything i said in those notes app. at this point, i feel like everyone is drifting away from me. i started talking to a lot of new people because lowkey, i tell to anyone who listens. it’s really bad but idk. i’m procrastinating all my work and it’s not okay. shit is so late. nothing really eases the pain, i want to start resorting to drugs so i forgot. i feel so lost in this inescapable reality. like i’m getting sucked in a hole of darkness and negativity. i feel like there’s absolutely nothing i can do. nothing eases the pain. i want to blame someone for creating this much pain for me but i can only blame myself. it feels like nobody is listening anymore. like i’m just screaming into the void. i just write these stupid spam posts in hopes of easing the pain but nothing works. i’m just screaming at the top of my lungs for help in space, the sound is going nowhere. i can’t man. along with this i’m actually concerned about my highs. i’m honestly high key concerned that my highs are becoming maniac. i think so highly of myself when i’m at my highs and i just joke about it. hopefully i’m not actually bipolar but i mean fuck man what’s one more mental illness to&#064;my fucked up brain. the only productive thing i did was listen to 4 new albums. fuck being alive. it’s just pain</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202012/128616069_437291760768125_752148494455307840_n_17844096704488157.jpg"><img

them. anyways i had my therapy appointment today and it was nice. my therapist calls me out and i’m just like well i agree with you but my mind disagrees because these ideas are legit ingrained in my mind. but now that i think about, capitalism is legit so toxic. the ideas that capitalism stand for is good in like a societal standpoint ig? but like if you apply it to your daily life you get fucked. it’s honestly fucking bad. but yeah i feel like i’ve just been set up for failure, i’ve had so much toxic shit ingrained in my mind that it’s not sustainable. competitive badminton kinda fucked me. esp my coach laurence lowkey ducked me a lot. he’s done a lot for me in the club but tbh, he lowkey destroyed my passion for badminton by solely making it about results. his ego made me love badminton for ego and basically just ingrained a bunch of shit mentality in me. my parents have to more an extent but there tryna fix things. i’ve just been set up for failure. not

love i have for her just doesn’t equal. i feel so bad about it. also, i feel so unprepared and a failure to be when it comes to romantic relationships. like i just don’t know how to make relationships work and idk if i’m even ready for one. kinda ironic how i’m searching for one. i just feel like i’m just that everything i do is to cope. it feels really bad just thinking about how i’m using everyone to not be sad. i’m just done with everything man. the hatred i have for myself is absurd honestly. there’s so many different things running through my mind. i just want to cry or die or just ease the pain. i feel loke i’ve feel so far down that i can’t get back up. my mental health feels completely ruined. whatever i’m just going to bed. also i can’t take care of myself for my

feel like living. but i went out with friends and we cocked around for a hour and we started talking about our feelings. it was really nice. i’m feeling a peaceful contentment rn. just at ease rn. honestly tho, i just wonder if i’m doing everything to cope. i feel like there’s this inescapable discontent and nihilism which i just distract myself by doing things. i really wonder, am i genuinely interested in this girl or do i just want to distract myself from feeling empty. do i just use my friends as a coping mechanism. am i just using everything to cope or am i living life. everything feels so unfixable. actually i feel so unfixable, i try to be happy so hard but can’t. it feels demoralizing as hell knowing that i can’t even feel alive. like technically i don’t even feel like i’m human. along with this, when i feel like dying that emotion is really strong but when i feel like living i’m just kinda indifferent. hopefully my antidepressants kick in soon, they kick in around this week or next.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202011/FQIoAkMzLBdAK8zMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17875393847010893" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a

literally get ducked because of this. time to have another depressive episode and attempt at my life 😃. 2020 is just not the vibe. that being said, i’m just gonna grind skating and sewing during this time. i actually really want to go to school, just to talk to ppl irl at this point. like how am i supposed to hit on girls if i can’t talk to them irl 🥺🥺🥺🥺. it’s okay i have 3 days to start talking to girls 😤😤😤. but honestly lowkey the worst part is like i don’t get to show off my fit everyday. like bruh i’ve been feeling really confident in the shit i’ve been wearing to school. it’s just fun dressing up everyday and having ppl compliment you. plus dressing really boosts my ego, i really out here thinking every girl likes me 😤😤😤. also i can’t really go thrifiting anymore so it’s just like bruh. man surprisingly i’m really mad about not being able to dress up and go to school 😭😭. it was genuinely one of the things i looked forward to doing. now i’m just gonna dress like ass in the house. tbh i’m not gonna miss my friends that much? i think i’ll still be able to see you guys and vibe idk tho? it sucks. but highkey i wanted to talk to new ppl but now that’s just hard. it doesn’t help that i hate texting ppl, shits lame asf. i’m fr really concerned about my mental health, i leave the house a lot just so i don’t go crazy. even tho this is stupid asf, i actually wanted to start meeting new girls and lowkey look for someone. it’s just fun looking for someone ngl and just hitting on random ppl just because. i also feel like i reacted the minimum of mental stability to have a somewhat healthy relationship. also because i have a suspicion that someone is interested in me rn 😳😳😳. but lowkey i feel like my suspicion is solely because my ego is super high. but idk. also ngl i just want to thot around rn. just fuck around but never really commit to a relationship. but then again i’ll say this and end up dating a girl for a year. i’ve also realized i’m super insecure.

get rings next. you already know hella girls complimented them 😤😤. tbh ppl i didn’t even expect complimented them and i was like damn okay. i might be super egotistical and overconfident but i swear someone is eyeing me because of this particular situation. yeah i’m just being egotistical actually but whatever. ignorance is bliss. i feel like i need to restructure one of my friendships, tbh i’ve been acting really toxic in it and i kinda just realized and was like bruh i’m being super retarded. well i wouldn’t say really toxic but i’ve just been fucking with the boundaries. i’ll figure it out

with arthur, nimai and howard for like 5-6 hours and that was fun as shit. i was laughing the entire time, i stg laughing burned all my calories cause i’m tired as shit. it was genuinely such a fun time. i think i’ve basically made up my mind, i’m dropping ib. i’m gonna drop everything except philosophy and physics, maybe english too. i might take art ib or art regular idk. i’m lowkey not ready to talk to regular kids, tbh i’m just gonna sit there and not talk to anybody. at the end of the day, i don’t want to continue living life living up to my own expectations. i actually want to live life where i’m happy and where i actually enjoy the things i do. i’m honestly done trying to work for my happiness. at the end of the day, with the way i was going, there was no way i’d be living life, just constantly trying to prove to myself that i’m worthy of happiness. i’ll never start living life with that mindset. so that’s why i’m choosing to live life now. idk what i’m gonna do tbh. lowkey i want to get into sewing and just make random garments with theifited clothes. like i’ll thrift of huge jeans and somehow make them fit for me. or i’ll make patchwork jeans or something. might dick around and start a small business where i sell custom pants 😤😤😤. it just seems fun to do tbh. honestly tho my life is a lot better. a lot of the stressors in my life are being cut out and even tho i’m not proud of myself, my parents and all of you guys are proud of me and support me. so it’s really nice that everyone has shown up for me. that being said randomly in the days i’ll be like life is hopeless ima die but usually that thought goes away. it’s a daily thing which sucks tho :((. i think i value loyalty a lot, tbh i’m really scared i’m going to succumb to unloyalty. tbh i just feel like i’m in debt to you guys and i just want to show my appreciation. i’m really scared that i’ll leave you guys behind ig. even tho i’ll meme on it a lot, one of the worst feelings for me is

therapy appointment and my therapist straight up just convinced me to drop full ib. she’s like when are you gonna be enough tho? when is the grind over? why don’t you treat yourself like how you treat your friend? when are you gonna start living life? tbh i had no counter arguments. but what was super cool was this protocol that they do. so they took the earliest memory of me feeling unworthy and they would move the memory from the trauma and rational part of the brain to the memory part. to do that there was this metronome playing in my ear and i started remembering all the feelings in the earliest part. i noted my tension, like in the heart and legs. then all the sudden i started seeing white (my eyes were closed). then i felt like i was suspended in space, almost weightless and the whole world was on its side. then i started imagining i was hanging onto a cliff with one hand. my therapist asked me who i needed to get myself up onto the cliff and i said my older self. then i started hugging myself and i tried to hold him as tight as i could, i was about to cry irl. then he disappeared from my hands like a ghost and i just turned around and started enjoying the scenery, there were trees and mountains and a blue blue lake. i literally got hypnosis done or smth. or like i essentially took psychedelics. i felt so good after, so content and at peace when i was looking at the scenery. it was a crazy but honestly enjoying and fun experience. anyways i randomly thought about dying today but i skated with howard at 10. i can now shuvit and pop shuvit. when i landed my first pop shuvit i literally screamed so hard, there was so much adrenaline running through my veins. i was so fucking happy that high was amazinf. i was so fucking excited bro. i was on so much adrenaline tryna do the trick and after that it took me like 30 minutes to realize i had an open wound LOL. overall today was pretty enjoyable, i skated a lot and enjoyed it a lot. i’m still happy from that high. shit felt amazing. but tbh one thing is making me really insecure but it’s just me overthinking shit.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

life ain’t that bad. and then randomly recently, i just got depressed for no reason and was like what if i died 😍😍😍. idk man it’s honestly really bad how unstable my feelings can be. i’m also very insecure about certain things so that fucks with me. i can relate to first slide a lot, honestly i didn’t get help for a long time because i thought i was just making a big deal of emotions. even now i’m like what if i’m a psychopath who is really desperate for attention and is fake depressed. it doesn’t help that suicidal thoughts were super normalizes. until recently i thought everyone was kinda suicidal. everyone in westmount lowkey was 😳😳. but fr i thought i was just being a little bitch about being suicidal cause i thought it was a universal experience. also i feel like i’m over sharing my suicide attempt. at this point i really want to tell a lot of ppl because 1. make them feel really bad about making suicidal jokes and cancelling them because it’s funny asf 2. joke about it with them because honestly joking about it is super funny and how i cope with it. i have infinite leverage, if you guys make fun of me one more time i’ll just die 😤😤😤. i need to treat my life with more value. anyways i fucking love howard, this guy agreed to do a TOK assignment for me. actually he asked me to do it. i actually love him. like genuinely i was like damn bro you’re willing to do this assignment. i actually love this guy. man keeps me sane. today was fun tho, i hung out with howard ben and emma for like 3 hours. it was kinda braindead but fun. also ben can ollie now which is sick. other than randomly having suicidal thoughts at the end, life is honestly pretty good. i’m seriously thinking of dropping ib and only taking two and going into art ib or smth for fun. or like a sewing elective or smth. i literally tried to suicide attempt maybe full ib isn’t healthy for me. i still need to think it thru. also it’s crazy how i got admitted into a psych ward</div><div class="_3-95

there’s so many girls that are music elitist so there’s a chance i’ll find a girl who listens to death grips 🥺🥺🥺🥺. i just need to search for a girl who i can debate with the album of all time is 😤. honestly my life rn is, be me, be happy, not think about dying and not think about being a burden and not thinking about how painful and hard life is. or it’s, be me, be sad, realize that the only reason live is for my friends and family, think i’m a burden, lose reason to live, create fantasies in my head 😍😍😍, be sad, use coping mechanisms in excess like eat a shit ton of snacks and nap, cry, talk to one person about thoughts, feel better after. crazy how a few hours ago i was like gg my life is over. i had a temper tantrum in my car alone and i just realized that today has been the worst day ever since i attempted 😃. i was experiencing all symptoms of depression today 😎. okay i’m just saying this cause why not but i will not cut in the future and i do not cut. but fr tho i’m just curious why people cut and does it make ppl feel better? it makes me want to do it just to try (this sounds stupid asf but idk anything to numb the pain 😍😍😍) anyways today was dog shit but i feel good

some girly earrings” or some shit and i would be like you’re just insecure fuck yourself LOL. it would’ve been so fucking funny. i’m gonna cry now fuck this. anyways today was fun asf, i didn’t do jack this morning just played aram. i had lunch with howard and ben which was fun. then me and howard went to 17th and went to two record stores. man really was out here and copped OK COMPUTER by radiohead on cd. i wanted to cop pure comedy cause that album cover is so fire to look at but unfortunately i didn’t. i’ll spam the album and cop it soon 😤. anyways after that we went to millennium skate park and we saw some 9 year olds that were so fuckong god. they were miles better then us. i was grinding my kickflip a and i’m getting somewhere but no where far. i just want to kickflip. howard is insane for kickflipping tho. fuck man all i want to do is wear my clothes, skate and buy vinyls. fuck i have no money. i think ik the fit for tmmrw, lemme borrow your dickie’s susie. also get a jordan 1 mid susie and wear super baggy pants so nobody knows it’s not a high. they go for for like $240? i need to start grinding skin care but i’m just so fuckong lazy. i need to do it tho fuck. maybe i’ll research and then buy some products and actually commit to it. speaking of committing i should skate a little bit everyday to improve faster. i also need new shoes for skating lowkey. i should get a job so i can buy a jordan 1 high. i’m just too lazy and my excuse to myself is i’m already sacrificing a lot of my mental health for school nevermind school and job. but that’s bullshit my spending habits require a job and earning money = dopamine. i can’t be bothered tho. i like how my life is where i just don’t do shit on the weekends and weekdays except the day before a test.

wearing fits is so hard. requires literally so much brainpower. it can take me 20 min to be like this is the fit and vibe today. earrings are hard as hell to put in. i’m lowkey sketched my ears healed cause i couldn’t get it in after 20 min of trying. hopefully i do hw tmmrw. the jordan 1 are actually clean asf lowkey, i just need a job to afford them. i feel like i should start working but idk man there’s a lot of things that make me miserable and i’m not tryna add on the list. life is okay for now, i randomly get sad thinking about things and that sucks a lot. i get randomly sad a lot and it sucks. the moment passes but idk something is happening rn and i don’t want it to happen but i’m just accepting it at this point. hopefully it’ll work out at the end but probably not in the most ideal way 😔. also was i really so lonely that i started being infatuated with ****, she’s straight up not that cute and dresses kinda bad. what depression does to a man.</div><div class="_3-95

school. now i just feel so overwhelmed again, i just feel like i’ll never be able to get back into things. now that my negative emotions has arisen, all these thoughts and insecurities explode with them. i end up overreacting to things.  i feel like i’m losing the positive traits i had, i feel like i’m no longer hard working or focused. i feel like i’m unworthy again. i feel like i don’t deserve the people in my life. i feel like i don’t deserve the success i’ve gotten. i feel so lost in everything, i feel like i’m in such a bad mental state i’m just exhausting the people supporting. i feel like i’m not there for people like there for me. i just want to be better but everything seems to tell me that i won’t be better. this feeling and belief of unworthiness is so instilled in me and my belief system that idk how to get it out. the truth is, at the end of the day we’re only on this earth for each other. but when these feelings overtake me, i lose the only connection that keeps me

gotta save money for that. the turntable is lowkey not the best, it’ll do it’s job for now but i am just scared that it’ll scratch my records. i also need vinyl cleaner but yeah. i also should get like a good pair of cheap headphones, i’m probably gonna get those first, there around $80. lowkey gonna spend a lot of money collecting vinyls lmao. it’s just fun taking care of them and listening to albums. christmas is coming up too so i can ask something, like a turntable or some really good speakers. hanging out with grace is fun, we always have something nice to talk about. i went home and legit played 5 hours of league but idrc. i also told vicky i have igor on vinyl sorry &#064;richard.z.hang it’s literally over for you. i swear bro i’ll just bring my igor record to school and legit

lowkey being sad and in my feels no cap. when i was finding backgrounds i saw a bunch of really cute relationship ones and i was like bruh okay man no need to make me cry rn. xd always heartbroken because the only way i cope with the meaningless and emptiness is by idealizing a relationship so i can hope for something in the future 😃😃😃😃. also always idealizing my relationship with my ex because i think my life was perfect back when i was with her. if not perfect atleast a whole lot better then rn 😃😃😃😃. instead of enjoying the present my mind lives in an idealized past and future 😎. best part is i’m aware of my thoughts but i can’t stop the emotions 😎. ever since i’ve been cuddled i’ve been touch deprived 24/7. might fuck around and ask to cuddle angel 😤. might fuck around and fuck angel 😤. think about it this way, friends with benefits with angel, no attempted suicide. no longer friends with benefits with angel, attempts suicide. idk man but the correlation is there. and you already correlation = causation. tfw you ask your ex for cuddles and sex because you miss what you had but don’t have the dedication and commitment for a relationship. tfw you cope with emptiness with sex. tfw the emptiness won’t leave. go away man i’m happy in the day times stop destroying my vibes when it’s late at night. okay maybe i’m actually empty 24/7 but i want to live because my friends make me

me. lowkey i don’t want a gift but i’ve heard you already bought it so i’m not gonna not&#064;accept it. unless it’s expensive asf then fuck that. you guys really didn’t need to get me a gift tho. but now that you have i’m adding more people on my spam just in case 😤. but fr tho thank you guys for doing this for me, you’ve all been really supportive and nice about everything. thank you guys for being my friends honestly. the program was useless lowkey but it really helped me find a reason to live. when you guys got taken away i realized that i want to live for my friends and family. hopefully in the future i want to live for myself but rn i want to push through for you guys. honestly i didn’t even want to get better, i was so hopeless and lost that i really believed that dying was the only option. but now i’ve just realized that i want to live so i can talk to you guys and do things with you guys. i really love all of you and really care about all of you. and i think all of you really care about me. i just wanted to say thank you for sticking with me, it must be hard seeing me go through all of this. i’m glad you guys did tho, i’m glad you guys care. with you guys i have reason to live, you’ve given me life. honestly i didn’t think my spam would become this but i feel like it’s made me closer with all of you. i really cherish all of our friendships and i really want to hang out with all of you soon. when i say all of you i mean all of you. i miss you guys. i have hope in my life now. anyways all my teachers are really nice about missing tests, i don’t even need to take my chem unit test. it’s really nice and they’ve been all really supportive. everybody has been supportive, my relationship with my parents are becoming much healthier. i’m glad that such a bad situation ended with such good outcomes. my parents are becoming better and i’ve begun to realize that living for others isn’t so bad after all. i’ve said this a thousand times but to all of you,

transferred tomorrow so yeah. i won’t have communication. i’m really fed up with my life. tbh i always thought being suicidal was a normal part of life; i’ve had suicidal for a good two years but recently it has gotten worse. sometimes i really wish i could find love but i know i just want an easy and fast solution to my problems rn. plus at this point im not willing to sacrifice my friendships even if i find my soulmate. i feel like crying or smth but idk i just am in a lot of emotional pain. i’m exhausted from the boredom. honestly you could make the case that i’m in a prison rn. i can’t leave my room unless to go to the washroom and there is security outside my door 24/7. living is pain again ig. hopefully the psych therapy works</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video

there 7-10 days. i don’t have access to the internet while i’m there. i guess i’ll put a trigger warning for this part. basically what i did last night was take 1575 mg of sertraline. my normal dosage everyday is 50 mg. arthur and varun called my dad and then they realized that my pills were empty. i was inebriated asf and was laughing and smiling like a mf the whole time. we got to the hospital and they hooked me up to machinery and shit. i had to take activated charcoal which tasted like sawdust. i went to bed for like 3 hours and woke up. i took a shit and because of the charcoal my shit was completely black. it was hella weird. i had to wait like 8 hours to see the psychiatrist and they recommend me to go to a psych ward. and yeah i called howard and that was nice. i’m sorry for worrying you guys so much. please don’t feel too bad about what happened yesterday, it’s not your guy’s fault. anyways goodnight</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

i can”” at the end of the day i’m so fucking useless fam. i didn’t do any hw today because i felt like shit. i can’t let go because ig i’m just stupid asf. i’m just holding onto everything except my life on gp. fuck the medication man. i swear to god this shit won’t be temporary. these thoughts are second nature to me, my life is plagued with this shit. what is therapy really gonna do for me? i’m just so unwilling to live my life on gp. i stay stuck on the things that have made me happy because i’m losing my happiness. actually that’s a lie, the medication is super clutch and it makes me happy. but i resent those fucking meds. i hate how free the happiness. i hate it. the meds just feed me happiness like i’m a baby. but what have i done to deserve any of it? i’ve just destroyed relationships and just gonna become a useless member of society on gp. i just take the meds because i’m a good boy who listens to his fucking doctors but fuck that. just because emotionally i’m not normal means i have to take meds to be fucking normal? fuck that man. why are my suicidal thoughts not accepted in society? just because humans have a innate desire to live? just because i don’t they need to control that? i just want my thoughts free even if it destroys me. atleast it’s me. atleast i’m not a product of something that gives me undeserved serotonin. i’m actually me. that’s what i want. even if it completely destroys me, i want to be myself. even if i become stripped of all my happiness atleast i’m myself. okay now that the blood that’s boiled to my head is over and the meds have kicked in i’m stopping this rant because i sound like a crazy lunatic 😃👍. time to be a fake carsyn and go to bed early so i can wake up at 5:30 to write my essay. bye guys!</div><div class="_3-95

spent 4 hours writing my philosophy essay and got only 500 words down. im so bad at writing fast now and i can’t be productive for shit. i didn’t study for math either LOL. i’m so bad at school. i need to start grinding skin care so i can have clear skin and glow up but i’m actually too fucking lazy. whatever man. i just dicked around this entire weekend. didn’t do anything that fun. my entire life is revolved around dressing nice at this point. it’s the only pleasure i derive. wouldn’t be alive if clothes didn’t exist. shit is actually so fun to do. also i get mad compliments for the clothing i wear which is something i never experience so you already know it’s amazing. ppl saying i dress like kanye actually makes me happy asf. all i fucking care about is dressing man. like at this point, the most important factor to a girls attractiveness is their style. girls will range from like a 5-9 depending on what they wearing that day LMAO. i don’t even look at anything else at this point. it’s kinda sad to think about but i kinda like it because at the end of the day i base my attractiveness on effort and taste rather then genetics. what can i say i’m a good and fair human being. imo tho everyone is able to look like a 10 if they try hard enough. plus at the end of the day if you think you’re a 10 that’s what really matters.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

makes me happy. generally clothes make me happy. anyways if i think about it, badminton is highkey so toxic for me. currently, i enjoy 1/10 trainings and despise the rest. there’s no consistency with the schedule so i feel like i’m getting shit training and generally not improving. when i feel like i’m getting good training i feel like i’m too shit for it and i’m falling behind. i’m just super unmotivated to play badminton. but throughout my life, badminton has caused me so much pain. my dad and i used to get into so many arguments over badminton. my therapist asked me where my feelings of unworthiness came from (which is like a main reason i’m depressed) and it came from badminton. just the super competitive environment and laurence highkey. this guy pushed me to become this way and idk how i feel about it. the only good things that came out of badminton were my friends and the experiences they came with. other than that, i lowkey wish i never played this sport. i feel like i can’t find a moment where i was actually happy with how i played. actually i kinda can but that was before everything went to shit. badminton is so toxic. also whenever i’m physically tired now i just go into emotional pain which is nice. i’ve lost so much passion for this sport and i’m beginning to appreciate my club less and less. they do a lot of good things but at the end of the day, a lot of the people in the club are just self centred. to be fair i’m no exception, i train when i want to and skip without notice. but idk the bond that was built from grind is gone. it feels like nobody cares. laurence wants money, huang wants successful students, laurenxe wants medals. i just want to actually enjoy the sport. i’m falling out of love for this sport and it feels really bad. i’ve never actually enjoyed this sport. i just feel like i need to get better to enjoy but never have. i just hate love. i just want to be happy. i hate this and everything seems to be falling apart. if i die grace and ryan can inherit my clothes.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202010/122910229_974190126414430_1603653525177493617_n_17872966199007581.jpg"><img

waist and the colour is immaculate. i love these pants so much. i built my magnum opus fit with those pants today and i’m so happy about it lmao. honestly without buying clothes i’d be 10x more depressed because buying clothes and thinking about fits is genuinely the thing i think about most in my life. it’s kinda insane. other then my insane amounts of werontonin i gained from wearing pants, i kinda felt like shit and idk. just felt like i was unworthy and not enough. the meds have helped my mood tbh and i feel better in general. my therapist kinda reassured me that meds were fine so i’m going to trust her. both of my parents complimented my fit today which was nice. i’m ready to just relax like hell tomorrow and not do shit. i have a whole essay to write this weekend tho so gotta grind. anyways goodnight all of you guys i hope you had a good day</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

today. honestly felt worse after it for some reason. i talked about a lot of shit basically how i feel like i don’t deserve shit. honestly she released a lot of memories like arguments with parents and like bad badminton memories and shit. made me think and idk it’s this long process to heal. feels like it’s gonna take 3 more months. honestly tho, i feel like my therapist is blaming everyone else except me and it feels kinda unfair. like idk man. overall rn, i feel pretty bad. i just feel so hopeless. i feel like what’s making me depressed is a belief so innate to me that idek if i want

hours of sudoku in one day. poggers. ever since i told my parents about being depressed they’ve been really supportive and wholesome. it’s actually really nice to see but i just feel kinda bad. i feel like i’m not bringing the same energy back and i just feel guilty. my mom told me that my dad was telling her about how i actually had a conversation with him and he was happy and i was like bruh i’m really bad at being a son huh? and when people say they’re proud of me i feel kinda undeserving because i’m not living my life to it’s fullest potential. i just waste my life playing sudoku or watching youtube. and yeah battling depression is hard but i’m not even winning. sometimes i feel so hopeless i don’t want to win anymore. i just want to lose and not have to deal with it. i feel like everything i do is just coping instead of living my life. i go to school so i don’t feel like shit so i can cope and i crush on random girls so i can cope. i’m not living. i honestly kinda want to stop taking the medications. i lowkey want to feel like shit because atleast i can think about the cause of all of this. i just don’t like the fact that some external substance is controlling my thoughts and emotions everyday 24/7. i need to stop drinking so much soda i’m getting fat. i miss angel and love. i had someone to live for. i broke up with angel and literally got depressed. i still wish i could go back and relive the happiness and security i felt in her arms. how everything made sense with her. now i’m just lost and confused and empty. i had someone that loved me enough that it convinced me that i loved myself. she was that someone i threw her away because we were in love but we weren’t compatible. i just want that love again. it was so perfect, we lived in our fantasy. now i can’t stand living in my reality. i want my simplicity back.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

are showing thru my eye bags. i jokingly said to myself what’s the point of living if i can’t skate and then i realized that it wasn’t a joke and was like bruh 😐. i want to get put on suicide watch at this point because its like going to sleep for like 3 days. i don’t have to live my life for 3 days i can just chill in a hospital and do nothing but atleast im not a piece of shit. anyways i don’t

badminton today because i really didn’t want to do it. i didn’t tell my parents and still left my house to “play badminton” but really i skated for two hours and hung out with howard. my kickflips are coming soon. i just hate my life so much tho tbh. at this point i just self harm myself mentally. i guess i just have this innate belief that i just don’t deserve happiness lmao. i feel like the medication is a bandaid to my stab wound. because honestly as dumb as this sounds, i hate myself so much that i don’t even like being happy anymore. i’m going to be honest, i’m over angel but i still haven’t forgave myself for breaking up with her. i still think i’m the scum of the earth for being like yeah well i’m going to fuck up our perfect life because of all these reasons. look at how many tears i’ve caused everyone! honestly the emotional pain i cause to myself is actually self conflicted lmao. sometimes it feels like it’s out of my control but most of the time it’s my way of self harming. i just can’t fucking forgive myself for anything for some reason. the negativity just doesn’t go away and i’m conscious of it and i try to stop it but i can’t. and it’s so retarded because of the medication i basically can’t feel sad so i’m just constantly agitated and shit and this is dumb asf. i’m probably sounding like a crazy lunatic this rant but idec. i legit hate myself the most and i try to punish myself by inflicting emotional pain but i can’t do that anymore and i’m frustrated lmao. it feels like that is the only option rn because i feel like i’m living a fake ass life in my dystopia world where i take medication to feel normal. i don’t even want to feel normal anymore, atleast when i’m off meds i can control my thoughts and who i am but i’m just happy and giddy for no reason. i wanted medication to help me control my emotions but now my medication is just controlling me. my thoughts feel so artificial and fake and not real. i’m unable to think of something’s and it feels like i don’t even have control of my own conscious mind. okay i’m done sounding like an insane lunatic goodnight all.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

i’m missing something in my life. honestly idek i just feel so bad about my life. having no love interest is boring as hell and i just feel like life is so complex and i don’t feel like going through

like i have an inability do so. like i feel like i should feel really guilty and sad about what happened yesterday but i feel so indifferent. it feels like my feelings are artificial instead of authentic and it feels like i’m just smiling to whatever. i feel like now my emotions are so disassociated with my thoughts and actions that i don’t feel like me anymore. i feel like the meds are just controlling me instead of me. maybe this is just all because of the limiting belief that i don’t deserve happiness but it feels bad seeing people in pain because of you but you don’t feel guilty or bad about it at all. i feel like i should be punished but all i feel is indifference. the more i take these meds the worse i feel about them. even if it costs me happiness and my life, i want to feel like i control who i am and how i feel at the end of the day. i took the meds to help me control how i feel again but now my feelings just feel so artificial and fake. i need to stop using the word feel because i don’t feel anything. just artificial serotonin feeding my brain. i want happiness on my own terms and these medications are breaking those terms. then again if i go off and go into a mass depression again i’ll be regretting everything i’ve said in this rant because fake happiness is better then constant and egregious pain.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><video

allowed me to think about them because those thoughts haven’t been personally resolved. like i just feel like my medication is just making my brain ignore my pain instead of solving it. it’s really weird too, normally the thoughts spiral out of control but now they just stop. honestly it feels really unnatural. i mean maybe this is what being normal actually feels like. i cried a fuck ton last

medication because i slept at 5 and woke up at 8 lmao. not even that tired it’s lowkey not okay and not a vibe. tbh half the time drinking was fun asf and the other half it was depressing as hell. ngl slow drinking feels hella shit because i didn’t get as wasted as i wanted to tonight, i was just kinda drunk for like actually 9 hours. sometimes i just began hating life and who i am and that honestly made this night suck. i would be hype asf having fun and then 30 min later i would just be contemplating life. it was so cringe and just overall not fun. this morning i’m not that hungover even tho i drank a lot, and thinking about last night makes me think it wasn’t worth it lowkey. it was fun and all but i felt like absolute shit for no reason. honestly now my depression has taken a different route. it’s less severe but i just feel like absolute shit more. like my days will go from really high to really low really fast, but before it was like some days are really high while others are really low. i’m exhausted today and probably just gonna take it easy. also whenever i’m just by myself i immediately feel like shit but when i’m talking to you guys i feel good and it’s

of the side effects of the medication 😃👍. first i woke up at 6 today which was super int. i didn’t get a good night sleep and you already know insomnia is a side effect of the medication. and this is really tmi so just skip this part but like you already know the low sex drive is kicking in 😍. i mean i didnt feel that bad today. plus these side effects hopefully can go away after a few weeks. hopefully i can return to a normal state of mind in a week and not be so volatile but lowkey had lots of really bad moments today that just made me feel like shit. i get so discouraged easily now it’s kinda dumb. even do mundane tasks i get really discouraged where i become annoyed and just want to lie in bed. it really feels like i’m so deep in this mess with no escape because i’ve been picking up a bunch of habits in my actions that it feels like it’ll take too long to be worth fixing. also it feels like treating my depression will take like 6 months and that’s just a lot of time. anyways

those thoughts because at the end of the day i have nothing to hold on to. i honestly felt really shitty this entire day, i was lowkey just dying tbh. i feel better cause i played league with friends. honestly social interactions are lowkey the only reason alive so thank you guys for that. the feeling of helplessness and being a burden is coming back, tbh i feel like those feelings never fade just ignored. shaking in pain has become normal now, i do it so much it’s kinda sad. hopefully these antidepressants will do me good and increase the serotonin in my brain. but you already know some symptoms are insomnia, low sex drive and depression so we’re just 50/50 this rn. the worst part is that i need drugs to give me happiness. how int is that. idk at this point, hopefully it helps man.

depressants and i needed to pick them up. overall i’m skeptical about anti depressants, like will it really make me feel better and i’d it really me? but i’m willing to do anything to make the pain easier at this point. i don’t want to keep living life as a slave to my soul. i’m gonna be a good boy and listen to whatever the doctors say because that’s my only choice. i can’t do anything else except listen to what my doctor says. how pathetic is that. anyways my mom didn’t want to pick it up and didn’t want me to pick it up because she wanted to ask some questions for the doctor. i didn’t want that tho because honestly i just want the pain to stop and i’m becoming really desperate this point. but she insisted that she asks about it which would take like 3 days and most of the shit she’s asking is on the form they give you. then my dad comes and gives me the classic who pays for your meds, who does all this blah blah blah. which just made me snap which was surprising because i wasn’t even feeling bad. i just let out all this anger just telling them they don’t understand my pain and that because they pay for my meds they apparently get to decide whether i’m happy or not. then i just started cussing him out because i was just so pissed because they just don’t understand that i just wanted the meds because it feels like my only hope at this point. nothing eases the pain. he came running at me and we were honestly ready to fight, my mom broke it off by screaming and crying. she comforted me and apologized for not understanding and i just feel bad rn. my fury felt so spontaneous and random. it fr feels like i can’t control my emotions anymore. atleast i get the meds tmmrw. i’m just lying down in pain now. i didnt mean to do all of this, i feel like i’m watching my life instead of making the actions myself. i’m just in pain man i want to run away. i feel so ashamed for letting my emotions just go out like that. i’m just hurting everybody and it feels like i don’t even get held responsible because my depression makes me irrational. ig i’m not even rational anymore. my throat hurts</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

said i was like yeah that’s true and kinda big brain. tomorrow is probably the day i actually get put on medication cause that’s when my dr appointment is. i have 0 motivation to study anymore and do work, my productivity has gone to shit because i just can’t focus anymore. my brain keeps on turning off man 😔. my chem teacher apparently had a rant about mental health in class yesterday and i skipped class because of mental health and when i found out i got lowkey embarrassed and was like damn okay then. i’m fucked for the chem unit test tmmrw but i’m just too depressed to care. i just can’t find it within me to actually study and grind. i don’t want to keep fighting i just want to stay down man. it’s just so hard to do daily tasks anymore, i legit started feeling so much emotional pain in class for legit no reason randomly. just randomly felt really shit and idk man. lowkey grace told me that i need to believe that i’m enough and i’m like damn you’re right but idk man i feel like i’ve grown up my entire life thinking im not enough. i’ve honestly never really thought i was enough for my expectations. i’m fucked for my chem unit test tmmrw. someone said that they were gonna get put on suicide watch after this test and i just sat there like the little yk 😳. i feel like everybody teacher is lowkey concerned for me and yeah it feels like life is becoming more of a mess. see the thing is i’m doing everything i’m supposed to do, i do sports and i get good grades in school and i’m not happy. like i just do things that ppl will tell me makes me happy and it doesn’t. i’m going to a therapist and to my dr but i’m still not happy. idk man it feels really helpless because i just feel like i can’t solve this. like i’m doing everything i’m supposed to and at some point i’ll just completely stop trusting. honestly i already have, ive accepted the fact that i’ll probably be struggling with this my entire life. also my therapist said that having this spam is a healthy coping mechanism 😎. i took a 2 hour nap today which was really weird cause i don’t take naps but it was kinda refreshing.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

better. i went to therapy today and idk how to feel about it? ngl my therapist feels really fake LMAO. like when people are too nice it makes you uneasy. idk i didn’t think it was that useful but my mood lifted after so ig it worked? my therapist is really close to western, like it’s legit right next to shoppers. i have to grind for my unit test tmmrw so ima do that tmmrw morning. i just go to grind out three days and i’ll be in the clear and vibing. hopefully i can not be sad so i do good on my tests tbh. my therapist was like when you’re very emotional or suffering your cognitive and

going to school tomorrow. 1. i didn’t finish my physics lab because i was way too much emotional to do anything and couldn’t focus and 2. i’m sad asf rn and if i go to school i’ll just despise every minute of it. honestly my dad is just so poggers. now that i think of it he has said so much dumb shit. man keeps on telling me that i need to busier so i think less about my life and my reasons to live. like okay bro i’m legit grinding my life away and idek for what man. or he’ll just be like damn you’re so useless and that’s not even cap. it’s just too insane. not gonna lie here i wish i was wasted asf rn but i’m not and honestly kinda pissed that i’m not. it just feels so int because i feel like i’ll never actually feel like i’m living life man, i’m just watching it pass by. like i was actually happy for a week and this happened and all that happiness is just for what. and then now those moments just seem so iselsss because i’m angry rn for no fucking reasons. i don’t even feel like i’m in control of my own emotions, they just come from my ass and just start randomly happening and take control of my life. i’m not even control of myself i’m just a slave to my fucking emotions. i honestly fucking hate this it’s just so fucking stupid and i’m so done with my life in general. i just don’t fucking get it man. i don’t get how i can just be so fucking volatile with my emotions. now that all the anger is out im sad again. it’s just a cycle and it keeps getting worse. why am i so negative? i just hate these battles man, why is living so hard? i wish someone took me out of this. it feels like there’s no way out of the pathetic lifestyle i’m living and it just feels like this pain will become something of permanence.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a target="_blank"

because i actually need to do hw rn. i can’t focus with these thoughts bro. anyways generally my mood is highkey shifting to worse and i’ve been procrastinating hw all day. like i’m doing all my hw last minute and it’s not okay. it legit feels like i just can’t find the motivation to do it. like i honestly don’t care at this point smh. i woke up feeling pretty shitty this morning but it’s getting better. my quality of life is slowly but surely decreasing, i really do not care for myself. my life is so pointless lmfao. at this point idk what’s the point of all this man. i got one life to live but i’m out here only looking forward to sex and alcohol LMFAO. that’s so sad bro. i mean hanging out with you guys and i look forward to hanging out but bro my life is fr so shallow. honestly i feel like last week was only good because i just coped with the pain with bad methods. to name a few, overspending, overeating and eating little. i mean hey last week was the best week i’ve ever had. but now i’m just like why am i doing this bro. it’s just pain 😃👍. i don’t enjoy shit anymore, i don’t enjoy school or badminton or any of my hobbies. i just do shit to pass the time. i ain’t even living my life i’m just waiting for it to be over. it’s just so sad man. fuck man fuck this i actually hate this shit. like i don’t understand how i struggle so hard to be just like hey i don’t think my life is useless and a waste of time. here i’ll have a prediction, on wednesday i’m going to fully breakdown and go to school and say very little. i’m going to cry and i’m going to bomb my chem unit test because my mental health will affect my ability to actually focus. then on thursday i’ll slightly recover but pretend i’m okay and then on friday i’m going to not do shit the entire day and fuck. then on saturday i’m just going to get black out drunk because it’s easy. yk fuck it it’s been a rough weekend let’s celebrate that it’s monday. really fuck this man my life is so useless. tom told me that there is more to living life then alcohol and that made me realize how fucking sad my life is. like legit what the fuck am i doing.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

where my mood shifts and goes to shit. it’s so sad. the only reasons i’m actually living for is 1. talking to you guys and hanging out you guys and 2. dressing nicely at school. i’m lowkey considering quitting badminton because it’s such a battle everyday. it’s just a mental battle and it feels like out of the 6 years i’ve played this sport i’ve never been able to win that mental battle. i can’t believe my mood actually shifted but tbh i was waiting for it to come this entire week. lowkey just like when am i going to have my mental breakdown 😃👍. i think monday is the day. life is just so confusing and i feel so overwhelmed with it. i’m honestly overspending my card got declined today. i’ve picked up really bad coping methods but whatever. suicidal thoughts are so normalized for me now it’s kinda dumb. i’m seeing a therapist monday tho so hopefully he will solve all my problems!! we actually hate ryan wei now not even flame anymore. me and all the homies will never talk to this guy anymore. living my best life whilst hating the fuck out of it 😎. i have 0 resilience and want to give up easily. esp with my life. i just want it to be gg. whatever man we go to bed and sleep and

sad. new record 😎. fr tho i can feel the sad coming soon, in philosophy it kinda hit but we bounced back. i got my ears pierced today and that was honestly really fun and i enjoyed it. my dad going ham tho. this man really talked to me about how wearing earrings portrays me as someone that’s not as masculine and therefore i won’t get girls 💀. like bro okay man relax 50 year old you don’t need to give me 20 year old dating advice fam 💀. it’s kinda insane too because i mean i thought earrings were normalized with men but i guess not. it’s kinda funny tho but this guy is crazy. his evidence was like why dont the majority of guys wear earrings like okay man they just don’t want to fam? and i’m like okay bro so apparently everything i do now is to acquire a mate. i mean he’s not wrong i’m violently horny but bro like if a girl is really bouta reject me because i have earrings i don’t want her anyways. honestly i’m just waiting for 3 weeks so then i can wear some fuck shit on my ears. i’ll probably get the generic eboy cross to complete the loook but BRO imagine like pearls in a dangling chain, that would look so hard. i haven’t found anywhere that sells that tho :((. i want a generic dangling chain and lowkey want something stupid asf on my ears. i’m lowkey fucked for math tmmrw because i played league all day instead of studying 😳. it’s okay the less i study the better i

unhealthy and shit cause like i just indulge myself in momentary pleasures. which is still true i’m highkey addicted to pop. bro rn it’s really dumb. i either vibe out and live my best life or i’ll just be super fucking depressed and not live my life at all. like today i bought a pair of dickies and went skating with howard at 8-9:30. it was highkey a vibe and honestly fun asf. we also some guy get laid in his car. like today i legit vibed out. like this morning i was playing my music full blast and this guy told me turn it down and i just told him i didn’t care because this one joji song is so fucking fire. when you’ve been contemplating life for the everyday so now you live everyday you’re happy like it’s your last 😎. ig now i appreciate my life more because i know i have a 50/50 chance that’ll go to shit tomorrow. but fr tho i had so much fun today and was honestly happy. i’m going to get my ears pierced tomorrow because fuck it why not who cares. shits gonna be amazing fam. i’m going to go home and my parents will lowkey be disappointed but idc. i’m vibing so hard and i’m actually happy. life is so volatile for me, like fr man maybe i’m bipolar lmao. also i got a 98 on my chem test and highkey decided my mood the entire day. anyways hopefully everyday can be like today but i know i’ll breakdown again. but also suicidal thoughts are legit so normalized in my head, while i was vibing i legit was like okay so objectively i should die. not to&#064;make you guys concerned but idk man just thinking about it makes me think that this isn’t a matter of emotions anymore 😎. it’s okay tho i like living my happy days like it’s the last, i’m really out here vibing and highkey not insecure about strangers anymore. it’s really nice just being myself and telling people to fuck off when i’m just vibing to music.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202009/120331789_3331730400250403_8937219358154321160_n_17866211150070978.jpg"><img

_a6-i">today was such a rollercoaster. tbh was vibing hard until i worked out. i thought i would vibe even harder after this circuit but i straight up just got depressed. good to know that the feeling of accomplishment after a workout is gone and nothing makes me happy anymore 😃👍. the main thing is the workout is just an allegory for my life. i was pushing myself hard and then i was like why am i doing this? like why am i pushing myself so hard? for what? so i can flex i have a six pack so i can get girls? like for what man? so i can get good at badminton? like i clearly don’t feel accomplished doing it so why am i fucking doing it? it’s the same thing with my life. what the fuck am i doing with it man? like i’m pushing so hard for what? so i can pretend i’m happy? so i can be depressed and not motivated? so i can drink? like why am i really doing this shit man. i don’t want to live for somebody else, i’m just slaving myself for what? i just want to stay down man. i don’t want to get up anymore. i don’t want to keep on pushing thru when i won’t even enjoy the light at the end of the tunnel. i can’t wait till medications control my emotions. oh yeah and my coach told me that i gotta keep on trying and to never give up on playing. he said i can’t let my emotions control my performance. he’s completely not wrong. but i don’t want to try at badminton because i don’t want to push thru with my life. the harder i push the more i just question why i’m pushing so hard? is this pain for something man? i guess i’ll be more mature off the pain but who gives a fuck man. pain doesn’t even make me cry anymore. the only thing that does is when people say something to nice to me when i’m down. that fucking tears me up and idek why. makes me hella sad. the only reason i got put into a good mood tonight was just because of caffeine. i’m so reliant on drugs to make me happy man, nothing else makes me happy anymore. i can’t wait till i take medication so the drugs i take are prescribed to me 😎. i’m sick of trying i’m giving up.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202009/B1435F5B44DE853E08BE95336085298E_video_dashinit_17890278988679806.mp4"

guy was ready to prescribe me antidepressants right away. like okay man drug me up because i’m sad. in all seriousness i’m skeptical about taking meds tbh. this sounds stupid but if i take medication to be happy doesn’t that me my happiness is just fabricated by drugs. like i gotta take drugs so my emotions can be normal? that’s some fuck shit. also like will a drugged up carsyn really even be who i actually am. idk man i’ve also heard that some antidepressants just make you feel nothing all the time and i rather be in pain rather then just be numb to everything all the time. also isn’t a side effect of antidepressants literally depression. and isn’t there evidence that antidepressants are lowkey placebo. okay i’m done being the big pharma = bad type of guy but idk man they literally telling me take these drugs and your emotions are fixed. ig i just want to know how it actually works. i’ll still probably take the meds when i get prescribed it in two weeks tbh. also i almost got sent to the hospital for being a threat to myself. i was hella close tbh and maybe i shouldn’t over share.i need to get bloodworks but like bruh sounds hella boosted. i booked an expensive therapist but apparently if you get referred by your doctor the first 6 sessions are free so hopefully i don’t create a crater i my parents wallet. a lot of things are happening in my life and idk what to think about all of it. all i really know is that my life is kinda shit and idk how meds will fix me not really understanding why i’m on earth anyways.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

tell me how do i feel better and be normal or put me on medication idc. like they really like xd just breathe carsyn. and then they’ll be like what are your reasons to live, like bruh i came to you because i don’t have any 💀. idek man i think i’m gonna book a real therapist and not like the free ones that is sponsored by my parents work. but like it’s literally 200/hour like bruh i don’t want to ask my parents for that. plus 200 can buy me enough temporary happiness so fuck therapy 😍. also tonight i just feel like shit for no reason and it’s just going to go downhill from here. man i thought i would have a good weekend but it’s gonna happen again isn’t it. also with my school counsellor he emailed all my teachers that i was having struggles with my mental health (with my consent ofc) and lowkey regret consenting. yesterday mrs leong said good morning and wutzke was like how are you doing and then this random teacher asked me how i was doing like bruh wtf, maybe that was mrs. rivers. it just feels so fucking forced having all these teachers saying hi. just feels so awkward and like idk man it just feels bad being treated differently because of this. even if it’s out of sincerity and good faith it just feels bad that these people i barely have interactions with are being nice. it’s almost like they pity me ig idek i don’t like the feeling. same with my parents. ever since i told them they’ve treated me really nice which don’t get me wrong is actually really good but it feels so forced and overall just feels like they’re doing this because they’re scared. instead of changing to becoming better they’re doing out  of fear and it just feels bad. like this is what i wanted from them.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

asf. it slowly got better tho. i got a 72 on my chem quiz but you already know i’m numb to marks 😃👍. dunno ever since i bombed my math test ive stopped giving a shit. i gotta get good grades for my two unit tests tmmrw. i talked to my school counsellor today and tbh it felt good. like he told me that i’ve probably been getting bad grades because of my mental health and like rn the thing is my test taking is so dog shit. it makes sense that my grades are shit cause i can’t concentrate cause my mental health is weak lmao. idk he just kinda related to me and was nice about it. then i went thrifting with grace and we found some fire ass finds. like damn bro i brought clothes back and honestly had lots of fucking fun. it was actually fun and i felt like i genuinely smiled for the first time in a long time. it felt genuine idek why. plus idk buying clothes is just fun. but i bought like 6 articles of clothing for like $20 so worth. but yeah i had a lot of fun thrifting. then i had another counsellor appointment and lowkey was worst. like don’t get me wrong talking to someone about my thoughts was nice but like bruh it kinda killed the vibe. and i made this safety plan and the only reason to live is going to japan LMAO. it’s so shit. after that i came home and my parents are being more supportive which is nice. overall i feel good about today and better in general. that being said this def a mood thing. like lowkey everyday i flip a coin which decides what i’ll feel like for today but today def feels better. hopefully i don’t breakdown again but i mean we’re chilling for now. i’m not ready for my two unit tests tomorrow but whatever man. i’ve lowkey studied all i can so whatever happens happens. i’m still highkey happy about the clothes i got but lowkey wasted $8 on a trash bag that grace said looked fire</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202009/120093265_615628515768529_7154538865939963766_n_17845219067375325.jpg"><img

esp shit coming to school. tbh when i drive i just yell as loud as i can in the car just to let the anger out. i got to school and just didn’t talk to anybody because it just felt shitty. i went to math class and honestly i felt like my brain is just deteriorating because of the pain. my heart hurt and i’ve had a headache the entire day. i got a 73 on my math test. when i looked at my test i was just in shock tbh. then i thought about how my parents will just flame me. it’s honestly time to drop full ib ig. guess i’m just a dumbass. well fuck. i was walking to physics and julia asked me how i was feeling. tbh i said something shit and brushed her off and walked away because i was on the verge of crying. in the middle of the hallway. actually i did cry a little bit but i think i held it off. when i got to physics i just excused myself to the washroom and just sobbed. i was shaking and it was a really ugly cry. after a bit i was like well time to stop crying and feel nothing again. in physics i was on the verge of tears three times. then it was lunch. the one good thing happened today and it was that the cashier for pizza charged me $0.60 rather $6. then i just sat in my car played depressing music really loudly and just talked to myself and just cried a bit. i don’t even have appetite anymore. philosophy happened and that was the best class but it was still much of the same pain. i legit felt like the pain was just permanently damaging my brain honestly. like it was getting mushed from my negative thoughts. then chem happened and i realized the tables i made didn’t print. so that was awkward. and bad. the quiz was alright but like always i probably got a shit grade because idk how to take tests anymore. then i talked the most today to my lab partner, other then that i didn’t say much to anybody. i drove home and cussed everything out with the top of my lungs. i ate parents with my dinner but i just sat there thinking about my life. now i’m just sitting here thinking about everything. i don’t even have an appetite to eat anymore. my head is so cloudy. i don’t want to do tmrw.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

this weekend was amazing again. i’m pushing away the people closest to me. everybody is probably done with my shit. i ask for help but just push you away. you could do everything right and id still push you away. it’s almost like i want to be depressed and to do this shit alone 🥰. nah but fr tho, i should stop asking for help. i’m pushing people away because i’ve just given up. there’s really no hope for me, i’m a lost cause. nobody can help me if i have no hope anymore. the future i see is just going to be more pain and just more of this. i’m going to be working my best life at a job i’ll probably hate 🥰. honestly i’m not even in pain anymore. if i was in pain there would be some hope left in me. except there’s nothing left in me. i’m just numb. to be honest, my emotional state has improved 😃👍. two weeks ago i was really emotional but now i’m just numb to pain 😍. i’ve cried way less because i’m just numb. jk i only cry at night. last night i got drunk to ease the pain. then i called angel and she started sobbing. it’s okay tho i was so drunk it didn’t hit me what happened. there’s nothing left for me in the future. oh yeah today my dad basically said that i need to do study more. like what i’m legit grinding full ib while i want to kms half the time and i’m still not enough. like okay man 😃👍. i’m really just not enough for anybody. i’ve lived with the fact that i’m not enough for myself but really i’m not enough for anybody. i just create pain for everybody. i’m so done. fuck this. i don’t want to do this anymore. someone take me out of my misery. honestly if i could i’d get drunk again tonight because fucj this. it’s so sad but the only happiness i’ve gotten from this month was directly from alcohol. how int is that. there’s no saving me man. it’s just over. it’s just fuckong over. life is just shit. i’ve literally only felt pain this month and when i haven’t been feeling pain, that happiness has came from alcohol or just me faking a smile. xD goodnight boys.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video src="media/posts/202009/FQIoAkMzLBdAKN2yLQ5WBBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB17gcA_17896707244602332" controls="1" class="_a6_o _3-96"><a

every night!!! anyways i cried again lmao. i’ve realized i just cause so much pain for everybody. she deleted her instagram account because i kept on saying dumb shit that lowkey hurt her. i ranted something to her and it she was really hurt by it but didn’t tell me. i just cried because i’m fr just too much to handle. i’ve caused her so much pain. i cursed out my mom today because i couldn’t control my emotions. i was really pissed off from badminton and when i got home i just cursed her out from my anger. it didn’t even hit me until i left what i did. i’m really pushing away the people closest to me because i’m legit just not good enough. my problems are pushing ppl away. tbh these spam posts probably are pushing you guys away, i just endlessly complain about my life. maybe the first couple of times it was okay but you guys are just used to these posts and lowkey too tired to read them. i don’t understand why i’m like this. during badminton i guess i was looking depressed as shit because two ppl asked me why i looked so sad. my coach knew i was lost in my thoughts and asked me what i was thinking. i didn’t really respond but i wanted to say i was just thinking about if i wanted to be me anymore. i don’t understand how you guys can put so little effort into being happy. i also got triggered at badminton lmao. just so angry and done. life seems so hopeless, like i’m just grinding. everybody says being a teenager is the fun asf and the most fun you will have. guess i’m just wasting it then. with being sad. i can’t wait till i grow older with my 9-5 job. or uni where i grind even harder and probably even more depressed. if i’m not happy now i’ll probably never be happy. now that i think about it, my happiness has always been tainted with pain. this isn’t the first time where i’ve felt like this. i always end up down here. honestly idk what i’m living for. i’m not living for the future or for&#064;myself. i’m living for death. anyways i’m sorry i write these rants. reading these must be a lot of work. hopefully you guys had a nice day and a better life then me :)</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

off i got like a 78 on a chem quiz which actually pissed me off so much. bruh idek how quizzes make me so mad. when you base your whole self worth on your grades and when you get a bad one your superiority complex which you rely completely on for a reason to live gets thrown out the window 😍. anyways i was way too fucking mad for my own good and it was just not a good time. could’ve beat the shit out of somebody just because i got a bad grade. then i got home and i was just really angry and depressed but not because of my quiz. like i got home and just yelled cause like i felt like it tbh. my neighbours prob think i’m crazy. i was just so angry for nothing. after my temper tantrum i just lay in bed and was like wow i really love my life huh? i realize like i’m so lonely. i talk to one or two ppl about shit that bothers me everyday. i fr am just like i’m so unhappy and nothing makes me happy. ofc except alcohol 😍. i stg i’m only happy this week cause i drank lmao. whatever man maybe i get drunk tonight fuck it. i spent 2 hours just lying in bed, legit just malding my ass off. i was really just considering getting drunk today and if it wasn’t for playing among us, i would’ve really done it. i’m just so damn unhappy man. like does it really get better man? anyways i found out one of my friend peers is lowkey experiencing the same thing as me and i want to help but it feels really shit? i’m not close enough with her to help and i have my own issues. it just feels shitty seeing someone go thru what you’re going thru. i saw her texts and it sounded like me talking lmao. feels bad man. maybe i should help but it really feels like i’m in no place to. i also want to help so i can have someone that actually understands lmfao. the problem is like how am i supposed to help? tell her it gets better when my reliance on happiness is on alcohol. lmao no. i booked my counsellors appointment today and it’s tuesday. hopefully he doesn’t int me. i feel so indifferent rn which is better then pain. the cycle is going to repeat over this weekend and i’m going to breakdown ik it. fuck me man.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

shot while i was drunk. either way tia lowkey is dry asf and i’m like bruh fuck this shit i’m only doing this cause i’m drunk. honestly today was pretty good and i’ve had no negative thoughts. i had a lot of fun and for the first time in a long time, i finally let myself go. it feels good to feel alive. i was walking in downtown at night and i just felt so alive and free. like i actually enjoyed my day and i didn’t worry about everything. honestly tho this feeling won’t last long, i’m already hung over and it’s gonna be worst tomorrow. then schools is gonna make me cry but maybe there’s hope? maybe there’s hope that i’ll actually enjoy my life. obv i shouldn’t rely on alcohol for my happiness but today gave me hope again. maybe it’s too early to give up. life can be pretty damn painful but maybe there’s hope that things get better. that being said today is an outlier day, this depression ig has been building up for a long ass time and it’s not going away anytime soon. hopefully i will be able to feel alive soon again and not have to rely on the use of alcohol to feel complete and happy. oh yeah i got drunk cause it was the homies bday and he threw up at a park in front of a bunch of kids LOL. i was actually pretty damn drunk and i vibed really hard with him. talking to him about angel while drunk asf lowkey was the best advice i’ve gotten in my life and we just bonded super

reaching out for help is lowkey just hell and i honestly only have my shit together at school for the slight chance i impress someone girl tbh 😔. like the self confidence is nice but not to sound like an ass but can somebody just simp really hard and take care of me lmao 😔. i don’t even want a relationship tbh. it’s just not a good time when i have no girls to simp for, it’s just so boring and dull. i just want to crush on someone fam that’s actually fun. also i feel like if i go into a relationship i need to like stop being really good friends with 2 ppl and i’m not willing to sacrifice my friendships lowkey. actually probably for the right person. idek man i hate myself tbh and i hate school and just existing and living at this point. at this point my mood can swing and i’ll just feel really shit inside or i’ll just feel empty. i get angry more easily now and overall at the end of the day i’m not happy. don’t even feel like seeing a counsellor anymore but i’ll probably go to my school counsellor fuck it. honestly i still feel pretty lonely at school and it kinda sucks. ig that’s what i get for just hating on hella ppl lmao. hopefully i pass my drivers test tmmrw. honestly just want to run away from all of this, don’t feel like playing out my life anymore. feels like a go next if yk what i mean. i’ll ff at 15, oh shit i mean i’m 16 now. i need to stop posting these rants, i feel like i’m just pushing you guys away from me and just becoming the depressed guy. it’s nice because i feel like i actually speak my mind and it’s nice writing down my shit thoughts. like it doesn’t help in the long run but idk man. gonna read the last couple of rants fuck it. bye</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

have to book it and it feels really :/. like it just feels bad and idk feels like i have to reach out for help again. like reaching out for help just feels so shitty honestly and idk man it’s their job but idk it just doesn’t feel good and i procrastinated it cause i didn’t want to do it. that’s the biggy ig. other then that i’m feeling better today and i’m going to try and take care of myself. idk man i feel like i’m just gonna start feeling it again next morning and idk just feels like a mald. it’s like my insecurities come in waves and it’s like :/. idek man i’m just scared that i’m too much for you guys to deal with tbh. i also feel like this whole thing will pass by soon and like it’s like do i even need a counsellor like bruh. idk man it’s been building up for a long time too. usually it comes in waves like i’ll be feeling fine and then i’ll just feel like shit and insecure it’s kinda bad tbh :/. i’m kinda scared to go to a counsellor like bruh what if they put me on medication or like bruh what if their just like bruh just stop being insecure or smth like idk man. also it feels really shitty that i need to pay for someone to get my life together like damn. idk lowkey sometimes when you guys say i should go to therapy i’m like bruh they’re sending me to therapy because i’m too much to deal with. i think those kinda thoughts is what caused me to breakdown this weekend tbh :/. thank you guys for being there for me tho i really appreciate it. i’m going to try to feel better and hopefully i didn’t change how you guys thought of me. i hope things can stay

personal on here. please just unfollow tbh i won’t take it personally because tbh i understand. that being said i guess i’m just going to rant on here again. i’m fr built different boys 😤. mood shifts are just too amazing man. i feel like shit for no reason and it just doesn’t feel good. idk man i feel like nobody actually cares for me. i feel so alone all the time at school now. i realized how lonely i am when school started. honestly the big issue is that it’s just hard to find people i actually like. everybody just seems so unauthentic and like the conversations seem so one dimensional. i feel like other then this spam i really only have one person i can talk to my mental health too. at this point tho, i feel like we’re only friends because we care about each other too much but we don’t know how to talk to each other anymore. i just feel so alone honestly. like i have you guys but i still feel lonely. i still feel like i can’t open up to anybody. i feel like a burden whenever i talk about my mental health on my spam or to people. i still talk about it but i don’t let myself go. i just talk about some surface level shit and just be vague but honestly sometimes it can be really bad. i’ve sobbed so much at night these past few weeks and none of it has been about angel. i just feel so isolated and lately like nobody loves me. i feel like during the day i pretend but at night my emotions come back and i’m just like damn. idk man this post really feels like me asking for attention and maybe it is tbh. it probably is. also i care for others because it’s easier then taking care of myself. idk man. honestly it feels like there’s something wrong with me. i have no reason to be sad but i still am. it feels like im the only one i know that is like this. idk man tbh i don’t want to boost my ego but it’s lowkey cause i’m gifted. my expectations for myself are so high and i feel like whatever i do i’m not living up to my potential. i literally have it easier then others in school so therefore i should do big things. that’s my life tho, i haven’t lived up to anything. i haven’t lived up to</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

probably drew a stick man on the fucking board. fuck this shit. anyways first day of school was okay but i feel so alone lmao. like i realized i have like legit 5 friends and i hate everyone else. kinda depressing :(. i don’t even want to become with half the ppl i know it just so stupid. hopefully school will be fun tmmrw but honestly i’m just gonna get bored out of my mind tbh. the only class that seems half interesting is philosophy and you already know i’m ready to question my life and contemplate my life 😎. anyways this is kinda weird but i saw sauhe and she looks so different that i kept on looking at her because i legit didn’t know who she was. i only figured out because of attendance but she changed aesthetic so hard. idek man schools gonna be lowkey depressing cause ima straight up just not talk to anybody and idk man. like it just feels like genuinely there’s nobody to talk to and it just feels int. why are ppl in ib so boring man 😔. also i did chem hw and honestly i kinda enjoyed grinding school lowkey so hopefully i can get back into it. tbh my plan is to wake up at 5 and do hw and go to school and then i would my nights free but that’s unrealistic. lowkey gonna still try tho. also ima try meditate tmmrw? i lowkey just want to try it out and hopefully it’ll stabilize my mental health and just make me feel more complete. maybe i’ll just lack tho. also

_a6-i">mr. hornyborny here speaking facts. anyways life just feels so int. my parents have been perma flaming me for like the past 5 days and tbh i’ve built so much pent up anger from that. i feel like i’m just gonna go off on them one day. tbh anytime i get flamed i just don’t even talk anymore because it’s legit just over if i respond. fuck that. it’s gotten pretty bad tho. lowkey cuss them out at the top of my lungs when their not home. honestly i’ve just been cussing everything out just to relieve my anger and it feels nice but ik it’s not working. i’m just so angry all the time now. just so fucking angry man. i feel like around friends i’m fine but that anger is still their so i just have to deal with it myself in my bathroom or smth. been taking a toll on that mental health tho 😎. damn now that i think about this shit i just want to sit down and just die in the inside. it’s just so fucking int man. little things change my mood so much it’s just so int. fuck this man. i’m just so angry that’s it. just have so many negative emotions and idk how to get rid of them. i feel like the only thing i’m really good at is just hiding them at this point. fuck i just want to get wasted at this point tbh. can actually not feel shit at the end of the day. honestly fuck my dad all he does is perma flame me man and tell me shit i have to do. this man literally flames and i’m always like no shit sherlock. and they always have this braindead logic too and whenever i call them out on their shit they always just use their title like i’m a parent i know what i’m saying. or my mom will be like i’m a doctor i know what i’m talking about BUT WE WERE LITERALLY TALKING SBOUT OUR DOG LIKE ARE YOU A VET HUH? AND YOU WERE LITERALLY A DOCTOR 20 YEARS AGO. it’s just so braindead man. what fucking triggers me the most is that they just don’t value my opinion as an equal. they think so fucking low of me and ohhhhh just because they have 40 more years on me literally doesn’t mean shit. it’s just too fucking braindead man. plus i can’t even call them out because ik they’ll just say some shit even more so i just slowly build anger within myself. it’s just so braindead. it’s just unbelievable bro.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

&lt;&lt; making food together and bonding in the kitchen. but bro fr gonna start meditating no balls. i feel like that’ll actually be useful for my life. i’ve done some research and i’ll probably do the yoga nidra cause it’s just lit sleeping. hopefully that’ll help with my mental health too. also i lowkey wanna start waking up at like 5 or 6 no balls because studying at those times is just

negative emotions. i just feel so incredibly dog shit and honestly i just feel like i’m just really good at hiding them at some point. i just feel so fucking empty for no fucking reason man. it’s just so fucking dumb. honestly it’s from playing league alll day. idek why but fuck man. fuck this shit. dude it’s just so fucking stupid. i can’t find a contentment in my life. i always think about how i’ll be happy in the future and never how i’m not happy rn. LIKEWTF MAN. i just don’t think i’m enough tbh. i feel like i always have to get good at something to compensate for the self loathing i feel. i always think that a carsyn that can draw, gold in league and in an ivy league will be happier then the carsyn today. that’s just full of shit tho. if i can’t find contentment how i am i’ll never find stable happiness in the future. i’m just so erratic and my emotions just control me. i just want to be enough to myself but it’s just so fucking difficult. it’s so easy to loath and hate myself and think about the pressures i feel and how i’m not enough. i know if i just have a negative attitude, it’ll continue manifesting but what the fuck am i supposed to do with how i feel. like i just can’t let it out. why is it so hard for me to find contentment? it’s just so much work. i guess maybe it’s because i’m not drawing but idk man fuck. anyways in conclusion i fucking hate myself but that’s okay because one day i’ll learn to love myself. jk that statement literally just means i’m procrastinating and not actually doing anything. fuck this rant why am i posting this i just don’t want to do this shit anymore. i also want a relationship now and you guys will all be like go back with angel but my standards are so high that nobody is enough for me. because deep down i know that i just want the attention from a relationship because i can’t actually commit to one. i know that i just want to feel loved even though i don’t want to give myself away to someone. it’s just so fucking amazinf huh?</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a

him just talking about how to study better and it’s just too insane. like the ideas are like not advance but the way he talks about them and implicates is just so crazy. because you just realize how

league grind no gonna cap. i stopped drying just cause i’m ultra addicted to league lmao. i’m kinda disappointed i didn’t see my friends today at school ngl :/. just saw a bunch of ppl i know but not really so i didn’t say hi. now that i think of it there’s just so many people i don’t say hi to and it’s hella awkward lmao. bruh maybe i should be more friendly but it’s just too awkward fam i can’t. bro i want to get wasted or do something exciting this summer tbh. like idk man summer was just so fun but boring at the same time. fuck me. i feel like at the end of the day i just feel kinda empty lmao. maybe it’s cause i’m grinding league but idk man lowkey it’s just cause i’m not in a relationship. it’s whatever it just sucks feeling like thiS ig. also it’s kinda annoying when ppl just say just get back together. especially when i was actually sad about her because it just made me lowkey regret my decision and just made me feel shittier. i’m being completely honest tho, breaking up with her was honestly the right decision at the end of the day. i didn’t want a relationship anymore and just didn’t want to dedicate myself to someone not gonna lie. it just sucks that she got wrapped in my mess and it sufks that i still loved her a lot. also i deleted like 700 images of her today so yea. wasn’t even emotional about it tbh. was just like it is what it is.</div><div class="_3-95

get angry. when i draw i feel like i take off my facade i put up. i’m myself when i draw and i let my emotions show, so today i guess i was angry or repenting idk. things happened with angel last night LOL tell us something new. idk man things always happens with angel and i don’t really want to care to explain. she’s not gonna read this cause she deleted ig. anyways idk i cry so much over her. ive never cried so much over something. every time she cries i crumble, even tho i don’t love her that way anymore, i still can’t stand seeing her hurt. this morning while i was going to waterton, i was fucking sobbing my eyes out. which is funny cause i was in the backseat casually fucking crying and my parents are completely oblivious to it. idek why i cried. i just felt so empty. i just feel so empty. i do things that make me happy but every time, i’ll always feel empty at the end. i just want to be loved again. nothing really fills that hole anymore. i don’t know why it hurts so much but it hurts. i should be over her but she can still crumble my soul at will. i just don’t understand how. i’m so sick of feeling empty tbh. i’m so sick of seeing her hurt. i’m just sick of doing this. it’ll be okay tho. i’ll pick myself up again, continue grinding. then the cycle will repeat and i’ll feel like ass. it’s okay man. i can’t believe how much control she has over me. i can’t believe that seeing her cry makes me cry. i cry so much now because of her. i’ll be okay tho. one day i’ll be happy and i won’t be empty. it’s just stupid how i’m so emotional over this breakup, imagine how i would react if something worse happened. i honestly wouldn’t be able to live though that tbh. anyways if angel you’re reading this ig yk more about how i feel. even though i’m hurt i understand and you don’t need to apologize. this is a one day thing and i’ll pick myself back up again. let’s live our lives together as friends and nothing more.

anyways tho today was a vibe like fr i’m just chilling all day. i’m mad at myself for not finishing unit 4 but ong ima finish it tmmrw 😔. richard i was tryna prove you wrong today but all i did was prove you right 😔. anyways a watched a studio ghibli film which was nice, honestly i miss watching kids movies. my ankle is still healing which is dumb, i sprained it pretty bad. like everytime i put a lot of force on it it hurts so thatll be like one more week. i need to start grinding kickflips. i hope that when school starts i cut out video games and just grind drawing instead. i’m just so

looked at the BOUJEE ass houses. like bro there was just marble on one of these houses and it was crazy. imagine being that rich. tbh i just want an apartment that i decorate. like i’m thinking one room would be like vinyls on walls or smth, i would hang pick all my furniture and their would just be art that i bought and enjoyed and hopefully if my art is good enough some of mine too. like i’ll ask my guest which one they think is mine and if they guess right then i’ll just take it down cause it’s too shit. i think that would be super sick and honestly my goal in life. i just want a nice place that i decorated with shit that’s meaningful to me. anyways i’ve been lowkey grinding art exercises and my understanding of perspective is so dog shit. guess i’m gonna try to learn perspective theory and shit so i can actually how 3d objects orient themselves in space. i drew some more grasshoppers today because why not and a shitty duck. i kinda like drawing in pen it’s kinda freeing in a way. don’t really think so much about one stroke rather i get to think about the entire picture. i’m gonna finish unit 4 tmmrw no cap. ima grind social 😤. i’m pirating this how to draw book and it’s really good apparently so yeah. maybe i should buy but it’s $50. i really like this youtuber called chroma moma, hes this art youtuber but i really get to feel a sense of authenticity and him in his vids. his art is nice and mans lowkey loving the life. he’s honestly just chill asf and i aspire to be like him someday. honestly i want to live like frank ocean. there was this interview he did where he was like bro i don’t feel pressure to make an album, rn i’m tryna swim an entire lap underwater. like man really tries to do what he wants and that’s respect. even though this sounds super idealistic i don’t want to be weighed down by a 9-5 job. lowkey want to be an artist who does commissions when i feel like doing them and when i need money. then i can go grind skating for 6 months and when i run out of money i’ll make art again LMAO. does that not sound like the life tho?</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

kinda proud of myself and honestly it’s fun drawing with pen. like when you’re just thinking about every stroke and just confident with it, it just feels better then just erasing and redoing. idk if i should share this cause it sounds stupid but funny in the moment. i was in call with angel yesterday and she fell asleep so i started saying shit to wake her up. she thought she was dreaming so she slapped herself and then i told her to slap herself harder and i just hear the largest clap and it was so fucking funny. i couldn’t stop laughing idek. it sounds so stupid writing it out but it was actually fucking hilarious because like how do you even do that. anyways i grinded league today gotta stop but it’s fun playing twitch with friends. did two social assignments today so i’m kinda proud

half the things i was gonna say but whatever. i’m losing motivation for art because looking at gods drawing art is inspiring and demoralizing at the same time. like i just doubt myself and i really shouldn’t. that being said i’m lowkey improving i feel like? i want to start drawing mechs and just drawing with ink and not sketching like a god 😤. internally i feel some type of pressure for my sketches to be good because i watched these calart sketchbooks and wanted to die inside. basically calart is this prestigious ass art school and you have to give them your sketchbook for the application and ppl post their accepted sketchbooks online and it’s crazy to look at. lowkey they are all masterpieces. league is regarded i grinded it yesterday and i was like ok bro. ima grind social tonight and finally finish unit 3 😤. honestly not excited for school to start cause ima have to grind school instead of drawing :/. the freedom i’m experiencing is really nice. i skated for a bit two days ago and even tho you can’t see my board i landed a fs 180. it’s kinda scary cause i feel like ima just roll my ankle again. hopefully i learn the kickflip soon. bro i love totoro sm he’s actually cute as shit and i can’t stay mad at him. i’m going to badminton for the first time but ngl the badminton grind is dying out. like idk man after i’ve done all these things while off of playing i kinda realized like badminton isn’t as fun as it used to be. like idk grinding art is still so fun and i feel like with badminton i either feel really shit or pretty good. art feels more stable. i lowkey feel a need to get really good at art so i can use it as a uni app but lowkey that’s not happening LMAO. idc i’ll try ig. i’m scared of full ib like idk if i can adapt to the grind again. i’m really excited for my drivers cause i have freedom now. like idk man now i can just drive where ever. plus driving to school is so much freedom. imagine playing blonde at 7 am 🥺. life just seems so much work at school and i like the simplicity of my life rn. like drawing and then skating is just fun. i hit the word limit boys 😎👍</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

wanted to say. colouring feels like it takes so much time and like my soul hurts everytime i use a lot of my pencil because the colouring pencils cost so much. i’m going to start art lessons september and i’m going to try to grind throughout the school year. tbh i want to do something with art. idk what i want to do but i want to be in the community and just feel like i can call myself an artist yfm? yesterday i was kinda tired and wasn’t as productive as i wanted to be. hopefully today i’ll be inspired and draw something and work hard on it. i want to draw one last eye because i’m not happy ending off the last one i drew. idk if i should tho. honestly even tho i wasn’t as productive yesterday i’m still happy i did one drawing. like i feel like usually i’d just give up but i feel kinda proud that i did. figure drawing seems like a grind and it just seems like i have to grind exercises rather then try making a drawing. i’ll probably figure draw outside of my normal drawings because i feel like i need to get good at figure drawing for some reason. idk if i want to colour today or sketch; i feel like i should colour to get better but i want to sketch cause colourings a grind. we will see ig. anyways hopefully i can also get on the skateboarding grind soon because my ankles healing! anyways a nice morning post and i hope everyone will have a good day :)</div><div class="_3-95

today and my parents are nagging me to sleep. the pupil isn’t circular, i really need a compass. the iris detail sucks ass once you look at it for long time. a lot of my lines still protruding for my shading. it’s hard to tell the difference between my skin and eye, the shading is too similar. other than that i think it’s okay and i’m kinda done drawing eyes. i’ve reached a point where i’m getting good enough at this that i need to draw something else so i can improve those aspects. like figure drawing or drawing faces. tmmrw i’m probably gonna draw pikachu and learn to colour better cause i can’t colour for shit. today was okay i just had a romantic walk with howard and we talked about our interest for 6 hours. it was nice tho because idk our interest are so similar talking to him is relieving and comforting. we had this hike with like 7 families and it was kinda stupid. fucking 30 ppl just hiking like bruh. i bought sketching pencils and a sketching book which was surprisingly really expensive. whenever i go to the art store to buy stuff the prices actually kinda make me cry. art is so expensive 😔. also lowkey i want to grind art and use it for my application to like an ivy league school because i’m really passionate about it for some reason. i’m honestly getting so much serotonin from drawing and it’s really nice 🥺. anyways today was fun but really exhausting day and i feel like i’m genuinely getting better at art. bye!</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

story isn’t mine. but honestly colouring is kinda relaxing and just fun to do. i didn’t learn any of the techniques tho and just went straight for it and it didn’t go badly. i tried drawing another eye today and it went ass so ima give up on this one. some part of me wants to stay up and draw because honestly it’s fun. i might just do it no balls and draw another eye who knows. like art is more addicting then video games no cap. also when i got my art shit i felt like a little kid opening his christmas presents. idk i was just really excited to draw and experiment with colour. plus i got this dope ass mechanical pencil 😤. i’m highkey exhausted rn because i’ve been lowkey working all day and when i mean working i’ve been drawing all day. i still want to draw more.... anyways happy bday howard. imagine being boring and grinding piano on your bday. also i love money store so much lowkey. it’s the only album i’ve been listening to.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

kinda happy with how it went. i’m just gonna criticize my drawing so next time (prob tomorrow) i’ll try to improve on it. i should’ve made the drawing bigger because i couldn’t do a lot of small details and shit. i should’ve gave myself more time because i went halfway through and was like my parents gonna best me if i stay up drawing. my blending is dog shit. like i need to learn to blend better. like the blending could be a lot better but that’s lowkey cause i got lazy. i should probably get a sketch set but honestly it’s fine? also i need to not get tired drawing. like i start to lose my attention and fall off so quickly it’s not ok. like idk i want to draw cause it’s really rewarding but my attention span do be limiting. also this drawing a lot better then my usual because i followed a tutorial. like ong this is not that good because one of you guys could follow the same tutorial and make a drawing just as good as this and probably better 😳. i’m still proud of it tho because idk like i feel like i’m getting better because i learned a lot of new things. also it’s just nice knowing you have the capability to draw something really nice. today was alright i’ve been pretty happy. i’m finally done this tutoring class which is nice but i still got one to finish. also i’m addicted to ice cream sandwiches rn and im lactose intolerant so it’s not fun. also jake paul wilding. anyways hopefully everyone’s days were good and if not trust me it gets better! like idk life seems like it’s only gonna go up from here because i finally got my shit together so you just gotta push through sometimes. anyways bye!</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202008/117231649_661429101125248_6751464368824281426_n_17898166588542037.jpg"><img

like all the progress i’ve made to feel happier about myself is going away. i’m scared i’m going to hurt her and myself again. idek why. idek why i’m reacting this way. i’m going to try to reassure myself ig but it’s kinda hard. fuck me man i can’t get over her for some reason and the progress i’ve made feels like it’s getting destroyed. whatever btw i’m drawing everyday because i want to get

ranting so i can finish my drawing lol. i’m in my feels again 😎. basically in a couple of hours i’ll talk to angel again after another two weeks and i was excited but now i’m sad. i feel like i’m just clinging onto hope at this point. like the only thing pushing me thru these two weeks was the getting back to her lowkey. now i just realize that’ll probably never happen again. to quote a frank song, “we’ll never be those kids again.” i feel like we’ve grown apart from each other. actually mainly she’s grown apart from me. she’s so mature now it’s kinda scary and i kinda realize that while she was growing ive been becoming more immature. now that i realize this im in my feels because it feels like i won’t find a relationship anymore. like don’t get me wrong i shouldn’t rely my happiness on a relationship but it’s disheartening to think about how you threw away one of the few things you had and that i’ve been lowkey clinging on the hope that i get back together with her. honestly i can’t think of a single person i would date. she really raised my standards huh? like my standards are high for people i actually like now they’re unbelievably high for people i’d actually date. if that’s the thing with love, it comes to you. i’m not particularly sad but my heart just feels so heavy. i just feel so uneasy and just kinda bad because of all these thoughts. i’m gonna finish my drawing now i just wanted to let out these feelings or i wouldn’t be productive. i wish i was excited to talk to her again but now i’m just scared of the truth ig.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

are so sweaty. like the paper was wrinkly asf at the end. i actually want to get decent at art ngl. like idk fuck being a math kid i want to be an arts kid 😤. honestly it’s just cause i find art much more meaningful and interesting then math. why do i have to be ok at math 😔. also ngl idk what happened but honestly i don’t think i look bad anymore. like i be that pretty motherfucker. jk i don’t think i’m that attractive but idk my self confidence has boosted a lot. like ima be real here the only reason i would want a job is 1. to get more clothes and be drippy 2. get a vinyl collection/ decorate my room. but yea it’s nice that my self confidence has boosted tho. i’m kinda surprised. lowkey want to take art classes and grind art you feel me? maybe art is my way to diversify my application to an ivy league 😤😤. no cap tho i want to get good at skateboarding and put that on my uni application cause that’d be funny. also i’ve been listening to the money store non stop. like idk

kinda crazy. honestly i lowkey blame my tiktok feed because honestly tiktok is like hard left. especially cause i’m on alt tiktok lowkey i feel like my view points have shifted a lot. it’s kinda crazy cause i was more on the centre before but now i’m like pretty far down. also american politics and tiktok politics is so polarized. like why is it so hard for people to be like both problems exist and we need to solve both of them. but noooooo we only can solve one. really is like bruh moment right here. honestly trump might get voted out tbh. like i didn’t think trump would get voted out because he’s lowkey too good at campaigning but i have high hopes. like he started bitching about how shitty mail in votes are because he’s scared of getting voted out. then again last time the odds were like 20% of him winning and he did 😳. anyways i feel like the universe is pushing me to wear this skirt and i’m just like bro. i’m starting to question if i really want to do it. lowkey tho everybody is telling me to be myself and wear what i want and i’m just like bruh. dunno i kinda want to ngl it would be fun. also i was gonna write an album review today but instead i played valorant and it was ok. tbh lowkey would’ve rather wrote it cause i had some ideas to write down. tbh i kinda miss talking to angel. like whenever something happens for some reason i always think about telling her. i think tbh it’s because she’s a lot more wholesome then all my friends. like i’m pretty mean but she’s really nice and the way she talks is just nice to go back to sometimes. this makes me want to text her but ima push through. 4 more days 😤. anyways i hope all of you had a good day!</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

Blonde is an album that explores Frank’s past relationships and immaturity. Often, the songs are Frank reflecting upon his own life and relationships, reflecting upon his mistakes and immaturities. This allows the listener to relate, as often many of those reflections are common, especially after a romantic relationship. Basically this put me into my feels.
A major theme to Blonde is duality. The entire album is filled with this idea of duality, including the title name. The official title name is Blonde but on the album cover the title name is Blond. Though they mean the same thing, blond in French is the masculine form whilst blonde is the feminine form. This minor detail relates to the album as Frank struggles with the duality of his masculinity and femininity. Another example of duality is through the guitar riff in the ninth track “Nights.” This guitar riff occurs exactly 30 minutes in the 60 minute album, splitting Blonde ​into two parts. By splitting the album into two parts we are able to see a change in his attitudes towards his past. In the first eight songs, Frank is reminiscing and trying to relive the memories he had towards his past lovers, even trying to win them back. The songs in the second part shows Frank accepting the past and wishing the best for his past lovers. I could go on for days about this theme but I’m just going to end it here because honestly bro this too long fam.
The production on ​Blonde​ ​is honestly one of my favourite things on the album. If I’m going to be honest I never listened to the lyrics closely most of the time but rather just for the musical appeal of the album as a whole. The production is a perfect balance of experimentation and appeal, not too strange but not too common. Along with this, the vocals combine perfectly with the production and allows the listener to feel immersed in the world Frank creates. Even though the production is immaculate, for me personally it took me a couple of listens to get used to the sound. For me personally, the songs with the best production are “Pink + White,” “Self Control,” and “Nights.” 
I could go on and on about this album, dissecting every lyric</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank"

review of blonde tonight on my spam because for some reason i’m really in the mood. i didn’t do social today which sucks but honestly ima try really hard to grind it tomorrow. i just want to do this album review pretty bad because honestly i’m connecting too hard with the sad lyrics rn 😔. honestly i’m feeling really melancholic. i feel like with me i’m too reliant on other people and things, especially when it comes to my mental health. i pour my whole heart and soul into these things and it’s borderline unhealthy. for example before i used to determine most of my happiness from badminton. that gave me a lot of pressure which wasn’t good for my performance and honestly i was super stressed and would take it all on myself when i lost. next would probably be angel, i forgot how to take care of myself tbh. then this really minor one was skating. like ever since i stopped skating i kinda realized that i don’t want to do anything anymore. i just put everything into skating ngl. sounds kinda dumb but honestly it helped with my happiness. been a lot more sad ever since i can’t skate because there’s nothing i want to grind. doesn’t mean i’m not going to try, i want to make this album review feel and look really good. plus ima try grinding social tomorrow. i feel like i need to stop using my phone so much and honestly just turn off my notifications for a lot of things. anyways i’m going to take a shower and analyze blonde for like another hour and a half and then write this long ass review. honestly might not finish it today but we will see.</div><div class="_3-95

reason. like i was just so mad idek why man. today wasn’t much better. probably tmi but you already know i was sad and horny 😔😔. fuck that combination of feelings man. it wasn’t that bad but it was just hella awkward. i didn’t draw today like i said but i’m gonna start grinding social starting tomorrow morning. gonna finish atleast unit 3 tomorrow. if kai or tom could send me the homework that would be much appreciated 🥺🥺. honestly i didn’t roll my ankle too bad and i feel like the day after tomorrow ima start grinding again. the dream is still alive baby. also i really just want to say fuck it and dye my hair and wear a skirt and post it on my main LOL. bro you don’t understand how bad i want to do it. call me gay or skirt boy but bro idgaf and it would be funny. i feel like all the badminton ppl would see me differently tho highkey. also bro i’m lowkey gonna get bullied at school LMAO. and there’s just gonna be hella ppl that think i’m weird or some shit LMAO. but who cares about other ppl opinion right? i wanna do it cause i can. i don’t have any skirts tho so i need to borrow someone’s LOL. also i’m scared that my parents will find out and they’ll be like carsyn this will be very bad for your reputation. cause that’s what they did when they found a pic of me in crop top. they’ll also think i’m gay asf and like i don’t want to convince them that i’m straight LMAO. like bro how do i even prove i’m straight to my parents. but some part of me wants to do it and be free. like me and all my homies hate conforming to society fam. but honestly skirts don’t look good on guys tbh. i have no idea why but it just doesn’t look good? anyways even tho the posts yesterday say otherwise, things are improving for me. i mean yea sometimes i’ll be really sad but i’m becoming more stable and happier in general. it’s been a journey and it’s nice working through it even tho it’s been like hell. some part of me still wants to run back to her especially when i see couples post about their relationship on tiktok :/. anyways hope you guys had a good day and sleep well!</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

we’re making another one of these. fuck me i hate myself hehe. i’m getting way to comfortable on this spam!!!! i’m so done with this shit man. more then 1.5 months and i’m still not over her. yay!!!!! oh yea the motivation for me to do a kickflip is kinda embarrassing. last wednesday angel needed more time away from me and was like i’ll talk to you at the 5th. i wanted to prove to myself and do something with my life by that time so i started grinding skating. now with this set back it’s almost certain i’m not making my own goals. i was so fucking motivated and i put so much meaning in that goal now i just feel like dog shit. fuck me man i’m so sad all the time and when i get really sad i always think about the worst things. not gonna be explicit but the shit not healthy i’m so sick of being negative i want to be happy and positive but i always resort to negativity. the negativity is so innate in me which makes me hate myself even more. i’ve realized how much i ducked up in my relationship and i don’t even trust myself anymore. i don’t even deserve love LMAO. it’s ok tho because even if i don’t deserve it i can’t help myself and not give a shit. i honestly don’t trust myself enough to get back with angel because i know i’m just going to her hurt again and more. i don’t know what i’m holding onto anymore. these rants keep getting worse and worse and it’s getting concerning. i overshare and it’s not ok. fuck me. i try so hard to be happy and free and i was for a bit but the highs aren’t worth the lows. fuck taking care of my mental health shits so exhausting man. i’m so god damn tired of taking care of it. thank you for reading two rants today i’m probably gonna head to bed now. my head hurts too much to deal with this shit.</div><div class="_3-95

hot 🥺🥺🥺. also for the second tiktok the tiniest duet is the girl from yesterday with pasta hair. and the last tiktok is smokepurp freestylinf and that shit funny. man rhymed limelight with limelight 4 times. anyways today was honestly fun with my boy howard. feel like i dragged him around but i bought skate shoes. got the classic white vans authentic and they are really nice to skate in. feels good skating in them tbh. i also bought a pair of pants that are honestly nice and like now i have like 3 pants i actually like in my closet LMAO. other then that i skated for a hour and i’m PISSED. bro i can’t frontside 180 anymore. i landed one and i was trying for a hour. i was so fuckong close everytime fuck man. IM SO DOG SHIT FUCK. idk i’m kinda pissed about that. also i kinda relearned it too cause before i never popped my frontside 180 so it was really low and barely counts. you guys probably don’t understand but basically i’m dog shit at skating lmao. ima grind tho and before the 5th ima kickflip no cap. been skating for atleast a hour everyday. i love my boy howard and idk i feel like i can relate to him so much. like idk we are so eerily similar it’s kinda scary but refreshing to talk to. also i want a pair of dickies so i can finally fit the true skater aesthetic 😎. life’s been ok but i get sad at night but everything’s been a lot better. so anyways have a goodnight everybody and idk tomorrow will be a good day.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

line. highkey fuck all of you guys i want skater friends cause skating alone is kinda boring. it’d be more hype if i had friends that would support me and skate with me. idk man this summer kinda bad cause like i ain’t doing much and i want to see my friends more. that beingsaid idk if i want to go with howard nimai and arthur because all they gonna do is play pokémon go and i’m kinda tired. we

just so much shit going on and i was basically emotional the entire day. bruh so this morning i straight up was not feeling it. like idk i just wasn’t feeling it and it was pretty bad and there was no reason. like i literally predicted that after my weekend i would cry and i straight up started fucking sobbing. like bruh idk man i was just so sad for no reason at all fam. i just thought about our relationship a lot and it just sucked. and then. my mom walked in on me sobbing and idk that felt pretty shitty but nice because she just hugged me. then i went to badminton and just was depressed and lowkey just holding back tears the entire time LMAO. like bruh i wore sunglasses so jimmy’s dad didn’t have to see how fucking red my eyes were. then i kinda realized that breaking up with her was a mistake and that just kinda made me lose it. like i was just shaking and just tryna not break down in front of people LMAO. but fr idk there was other options but honestly i still feel okay about the breakup. like we both understand relationships more and we’ve grown more. plus our relationship was rushed so maybe we just needed a restart button. anyways after hours of someone convincing me not to call angel i did it fucking anyways LMAO. i’m sorry i’m so bad at listening but thank you for trying atleast. we called for like 3 hours and idk were not going to rush our relationship and we’re not gonna expect anything. we just really wanted to talk to each other. it was really refreshing talking to her. plus idk we kinda just related on how heart broken we are and idk it felt good. so rn even tho today was A FUCKING ROLLERCOASTER of emotions i feel good. i feel like i can fix things and idk. i feel good about everything and everything happened for a reason right? maybe breaking up with her wasn’t the greatest thing but a lot of good came from the pain. also sorry &#064;susie.he for not calling today was a wild asf. also do you guys even watch the tiktoks i post?</div><div class="_3-95

life. like covid happened and life is different now. also just leaving her my life won’t be the same anymore. that’s how life is and i gotta go with the flow. anyways life is fr meaningless and boring asf but i’m actually enjoying playing league. idk i’ve never had this much fun playing league. honestly i just wonder when ima feel that love again. like i feel like the main thing is, is that idk if i’m going to find someone like her again. to this day our relationship feels so perfect and i just feel like i ruined that perfection. maybe i should go for her again in the future but idk. also tbh not to sound like a man whore but i feel like in the future all my close close friends are gonna be girls. which is lowkey a problem because i’m probably gonna catch feelings for all of them ong. this is gonna happen because for some reason i can’t keep text convos with any guy lmaooo. and the fact that other than this spam i only tell females personally about my shit. like now that i think about it for my whole life only one guy knows a lotttt about me. i’m gonna try to pick up my hobbies again but idk i feel like i’m constantly don’t have enough time. then again i waste all my time but idk. my days feel so long but like weeks go by so fast. it’s been a quarter of the summer and i’m just like bruh. also i lowkey want to drop full ib because i’ve lost motivation to do it and lost motivation to try hard in life. kinda just want to dick around and chase girls and get drunk and smoke weed and not give af but i’m probably not going to LOL.-</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><a

in a flirtatious way is a good time. ig i can love my life as a free man. honestly now that i think about i walked away from stability and happiness for freedom lmao. honestly getting over her is just

dramatic conversation that had me in tears we decided that it was better for us to talk to each other when we’re both over each other, and not just me pretending. damn fuck me man my life is cycle. i’m just gonna be happy for the weekend and fall right back down next week. plus i’m not gonna do shit with my life because i’ve lost motivation. if i just have to fight harder 😔. also yubo is a dumb

fast and made herself a better person but why do i still feel lost without her. i’m the one that broke up with her and i’m still broken. honestly i’m always in my feelings and this spam has been 90% me in my feelings. i don’t know how to escape my feelings. honestly i feel so trapped down here. i try hard to escape and sometimes i convince myself i have but i always end up back here. back at rock bottom. honestly i wish i knew how to fix myself because honestly the only way i cope with is writing paragraphs to my spam, my notes or my friends. i just write paragraphs about how i feel just to temporarily cope with the thoughts. i just want to be happy man. i’ve been so damn sad all the the fucking time and it’s honestly exhausting being this sad. then because i’m sad that sadness will just affect the people around me. i just feel like i’m drowning and idk what to do anymore. i’m honestly so fucking stupid for dming her before i was over her. i’m so fucking emotional it’s a detriment. i’m so fucking bad at coping that it’s concerning. everyday i just wake up and just get cheap dopamine like going on youtube and then i’ll just get sad randomly and rant. that’s literally my life. gg

idk. i’m friends with her again and like idk it’s nice but like bruh i feel like i’m going to get back together LOL. honestly bruh i feel dumb asf. like holy decisions are so hard to make smh smh. i think the part i missed the most was that i was actually wholesome and really nice with her. i feel like even though i talk a lot of shit all the time, i kinda want to be someone who’s actually genuinely nice. dunno man but ig we will see what happens. more drama in my life boys!!!!! also totoro is cute asf and he’s such a good boy man learns tricks instantly. i love him with all my

post gonna be about the camping experience. honestly i thought camping would be dog shit because i never like nature ngl. it was nice though and i feel like i appreciate nature more. also usually when i camp i just think a lot and i was not excited cause ik i was gonna think about angel 😔. it wasn’t bad though because i feel like i was able to finally conclude things and i feel like i’ll try being friends with her again. whatever happens with us happens and the future will only know. anyways we went on this kinda difficult hike and usually i despise hikes cause i’m just like bruh i grinded the hike just to see this shit view 😳. that being said the hike was nice because i was sad about angel the entire but when i got to the peak i reached a conclusion. kinda like i was climbing a mountain in my head 🤔. i think the best part about camping this time was the family time tbh. i actually enjoyed spending time with my family and honestly it was really nice. i feel like i get along with them better and it’s really nice. some other shit i thought about was how i’m going to get my life together. i feel like this trip helped me dopamine detox and got me less addicted to youtube, league and social media so hopefully i can keep that up. plus now i know what i really want to do this summer so i’m going to try to do that. i have so many thoughts i should’ve wrote them down somewhere but

feelings. honestly just want to thought dump so just don’t bother reading through this. i say that every rant because i rant a lot and most of the time i just want to write down the thoughts that go through my head. today i tried to delete the photos i had of angel but i just couldn’t tbh. i feel like i could now but when i went through those photos i remembered all the little things i loved about her. they are so many little things that it makes me question will i ever find a relationship like the one i had? like will i really find someone who will tell me that she had a nightmare last night and it was about me not giving her attention. will i really find someone where when i fall asleep in call i sleep talk to her and tell her how much i love her while i was sleeping. i could go on for days about the little quirks in our relationship but i genuinely feel like i won’t be able to find that love anymore. honestly if i could go back in time and change what happened i would. it really feels like right person wrong time yk? i’ve honestly accepted this reality and i’m not sad about it but it just feels so bad thinking about it again. i think the main things that’s been affecting me is that i honestly don’t really know what i’m living for. not to sound edgy but my life feels so meaningless. like what’s the real point of doing anything really? like i get that you’ll be happy and that you should live life for the sadness and the happiness but really what’s the point of all that? what am i really doing with my life? i don’t know to what do with my life either because everything just feels so meaningless to do. like what’s the point of getting good at drawing. what’s the point of making money, so i can feel better about myself? to be completely honest she put meaning into my life so now that i don’t have her i’m just questioning what’s the fucking point. like genuinely what’s the point of doing anything. i guess the reality is there’s no point of doing anything but like what do i do knowing that? maybe i’m just not busy enough so that’s why i’m questioning everything. life honestly is just confusing and</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><video

sad because like damn i’m tryna show you my love and affection and you keep growling and biting me 🥺. anyways that made me sad but it got better because he doesn’t bite anymore. it’s been a grind taking care of him but he’s superrrrr cute so it’s worth. i tried sleeping with him but my parents were like no don’t do that anymore and i was like damn i’m sad i want to sleep with my cute doggo.

sad with me. that’s just hella dumb lol. i honestly realized that i no longer know how to be independent anymore. like it’s so easy to try to make other people happy instead of caring for yourself and idk how to care for myself anymore. i also realized i actually crave attention like it’s literally a drug to me man because i used to get so much of it but now i get none of it. like bro i’m literally making this post to get attention LMAO. honestly i’ve begun to realize how much of a piece of shit i am. like honestly everything that’s happened to me has been directly from my actions and honestly i deserve it lol. like damn i really threw away one of the most important things in my life just because i never appreciate what i have. i think the worst part of all of this is how am i supposed to grow as a person when the problems in myself are my emotions, the very things i can’t control about myself. like if i can’t control how i feel then how tf am i going to stop this from happening again. i’m just going to be stuck how i am forever. honestly this whole situation is kinda funny because at this point i fucked up so much that i might be trying to make myself sad. honestly i just want to

house is too cold it doesn’t really symbolize what a home is supposed to represent as a home represents warmth and comfort. another for example is my washroom because my washroom is the only private place in my house realistically and i always turn on the fans so nobody can hear me outside of my washroom. another thing is why i love children’s movies so much. to me children’s movies just represent purity and honestly i wish the innocence of childhood. that innocence is really important to me and i always feel like i want to constantly recreate it. anyways this morning was really dog shit i was just trapped with my thoughts but we got through it and my day is getting better. hopefully tomorrow will be better but it probably won’t because i need to address problems within myself.</div><div class="_3-95 _a6-p"><div><a target="_blank" href="media/posts/202006/104704883_689362185245749_1631309804438424708_n_18104450014159801.jpg"><img
